## Business Quality Comparison

| | Silicon2 | YesAsia (ABW only) |
|---|---|---|
| FY2025E Revenue | ~KRW 1.1T | ~KRW 290B ($220M) |
| Revenue Scale Ratio | **3-5x** larger | 1x |
| OPM | ~18-20% | ~10% (estimated) |
| GPM | ~33% | 18.6% (disclosed) |
| B2B Growth (1H2025 YoY) | +54% | **+111%** |
| Customer Structure | 180-country long-tail micro-buyers | Online small buyers 72% + Large retail chains 28% |
| Moat | 10-year brand relationships + flywheel | B2C data (400K influencers) as bargaining chip |

## Key Thesis

### Silicon2: Proven Quality, Priced Accordingly

- Best-in-class OPM (20%) for a distributor — exceptional and sustainable
- GPM ~33% driven by micro-buyer long-tail (structural, not cyclical)
- Growth decelerating: +108% → +102% → +59% → +36%(E)
- P/E 12.3x is not expensive, but limited room for multiple expansion
- Risk: Joseon Beauty (24% of revenue) direct distribution move

### YesAsia: Inferior Business, Asymmetric Pricing

- P/S 0.47 vs Silicon2's 2.49 — **6x discount** for the same K-beauty distribution theme
- ABW growing at 111% YoY, faster than Silicon2
- OPM 7.5% today, but margin improvement path is clear (10% → 14-15% over 3 years)
- **Discount factors**: HK small-cap illiquidity, B2C mix (68%), low analyst coverage
- **Catalyst**: ABW reaching 50:50 with B2C → re-rating as K-beauty growth story

## ABW Margin Trajectory (Our Estimates)

| Timeline | ABW GPM | ABW OPM (est.) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY2023 (actual) | 23.1% | unknown | Pre-offline expansion |
| FY2024 (actual) | 16.8% | unknown | Large retail chain entry → margin dilution |
| 1H2025 (actual) | 18.6% | ~10% | Recovery started |
| 2026-2027E | ~21% | ~12-13% | Korea office matures, scale improves |
| 2027-2028E (best) | ~24% | ~14-15% | B2C data leverage + online mix increases |
| Silicon2-level | 33% | ~20% | **Structurally unlikely** (customer type gap) |

**Why ABW can't reach Silicon2's GPM**: The ~11pp gap in online wholesale GPM (~22% vs ~33%) comes from customer type, not channel. Silicon2's micro-buyers across 180 countries accept higher markups because they lack alternatives. This is a 10-year accumulated network effect, not something ABW can replicate through infrastructure investment.

**What ABW can improve**: Purchase price (Korea office + scale) → +3-5pp GPM improvement achievable.

## Scenario Analysis

### Silicon2 (current market cap: KRW 2.75T)

| Scenario | 2026E Net Income | P/E | Market Cap | Upside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bear | KRW 250B | 12x | KRW 3.0T | +9% |
| Base | KRW 280B | 15x | KRW 4.2T | +53% |
| Bull | KRW 320B | 18x | KRW 5.76T | +110% |

### YesAsia (current market cap: ~KRW 260B)

| Scenario | 2026E Net Income | P/E | Market Cap | Upside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bear | KRW 35B ($27M) | 10x | KRW 350B | +35% |
| Base | KRW 42B ($32M) | 12x | KRW 504B | +94% |
| Bull | KRW 50B ($38M) | 15x | KRW 750B | +188% |

## Decision Framework

| Factor | Favors |
|---|---|
| Business quality | Silicon2 |
| Valuation | **YesAsia** (6x cheaper on P/S) |
| Growth rate | **YesAsia** (ABW +111% vs +54%) |
| Margin improvement potential | **YesAsia** (10% → 15% vs 20% ceiling) |
| Asymmetric upside | **YesAsia** (bear +35%, bull +188%) |
| Risk (liquidity) | Silicon2 (KOSDAQ, high volume) |
| Risk (business) | Silicon2 (proven, diversified buyers) |
| Catalyst clarity | Silicon2 (K-beauty market growth) |

**Asymmetry favors YesAsia at current prices.** The HK small-cap illiquidity discount is the price you pay for this asymmetry.
