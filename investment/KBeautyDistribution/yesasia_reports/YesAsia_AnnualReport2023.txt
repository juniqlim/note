LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,
We are pleased to present you with the 2023 YesAsia Holdings Annual Report highlighting the Company’s
significant business turnaround and operational improvements. Our new focus on beauty products, the expansion
of our digital marketing programs, and the fast growth of our AsianBeautyWholesale (ABW) B2B business were
among the major drivers behind this successful transformation.

REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY
It delights us to announce that in 2023, YesAsia Holdings achieved record high annual revenue of approximately
US$201,339,000, representing remarkable growth of approximately 56.6% compared to the Prior Year’s revenue
of approximately US$128,592,000. Furthermore, the Group generated profit of approximately US$7,572,000 in
2023, a significant improvement from the loss of approximately US$6,782,000 incurred in 2022.

YESSTYLE RECOVERY
YesStyle, our flagship E-commerce platform, played a pivotal role in driving the Group’s overall revenue growth.
In January 2023, we changed our strategy to focus on beauty products and implemented a new front page. This
strategic shift, combined with promotional campaigns and expansion of our digital marketing programs, resulted
in a substantial increase in YesStyle’s revenue from approximately US$109,934,000 in 2022 to approximately
US$158,655,000 in 2023, which represents an increase of approximately 44.3%.
Our current goal is for YesStyle to become the leading online platform for global purchases of Asian beauty
products, with a focus on the continued expansion of the Korean beauty phenomenon to many more countries.

FAST GROWTH OF ASIANBEAUTYWHOLESALE (ABW) B2B PLATFORM
ABW, our B2B platform catering to global business customers looking to source beauty products from Asia,
experienced extraordinary growth in 2023. ABW benefitted significantly from the increasing popularity of Korean
beauty products worldwide. We witnessed ABW’s revenue surge from approximately US$11,601,000 in 2022 to
US$38,788,000 in 2023, a staggering growth of approximately 234.4%.
To improve our services and our value to business customers, we deployed a number of new features on the ABW
website in 2023. For example, we increased the number of beauty brands available on the platform, offered more
bestselling products in our “Bulk Box” option for business customers to purchase products in greater quantities,
and improved the processing efficiency of business customer orders.
We also worked with more brands to offer free sample products to business customers. Many business customers
find this offer attractive as it facilitates them to promote and sell new brands and products in their retail channels.

BEAUTY REVENUE GROWTH AND UNITED KINGDOM (“UK”)/EUROPEAN
MARKET RECOVERY
Thanks to YesStyle’s successful beauty product strategy and ABW’s rapid growth, our beauty revenue
saw a remarkable increase of over 133.2%, from approximately US$69,568,000 in 2022 to approximately
US$162,230,000 in 2023. Revenue contributed by beauty products as a percentage of total revenue increased
from approximately 54.1% in 2022 to approximately 80.6% in 2023. Furthermore, we observed significant
improvements in the UK and European markets, with UK and European countries revenue growing by
approximately 83.5% and 126.1% respectively in 2023.

THE OPPORTUNITY OF GLOBAL KOREAN BEAUTY (“K-BEAUTY”) BRANDS AND
PRODUCTS
We are thrilled to witness the growing popularity of K-Beauty brands and products in the global market, particularly
in regions such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and Europe. According to one recent study, the global
K-Beauty market is growing at an annual rate of 9.2%, and will reach US$18.32 billion by 2030. The K-Beauty
market has shown significant growth, and we are actively capitalizing on this trend.
This surge in K-Beauty’s popularity can be attributed to the exceptional quality and innovation of K-Beauty
products, and the increasing number of new K-Beauty brands and products targeting the global beauty market
with their moisturizing, brightening and cleansing effects etc. Also, many K-Beauty products are made with natural
ingredients that are gaining favour from customers.
We continue to proactively invite more K-Beauty brands to join our platforms. During 2023, we became authorized
distributors of 14 additional brands from LG H&H, including O HUI, su:m37, VDL and Sooryehan; and 5 more
brands from CJ Olive Young Corporation, namely IDEAL FOR MEN, fillimilli, colorgram, ROUND A’ROUND and
BIOHEAL BOH. We also added one more brand, espoir, from Amorepacific Corporation. Overall, the total number
of our K-Beauty partner brands increased from 430 in 2022 to 448 in 2023.

DIGITAL MARKETING UPDATE
The Company operates a number of digital marketing programs that have proven to be effective at promoting Asian
beauty brands and products to younger online consumers. We have successfully implemented several trendsetting
digital marketing programs, including the YesStyle Influencer Program.
Since its launch in 2019, the YesStyle Influencer Program has engaged an increasing number of influencers
worldwide to promote YesStyle products to their followers. In 2023, revenue referred by influencers increased
to approximately US$40,422,000 from approximately US$21,901,000 in 2022, representing a growth of
approximately 84.6%. The contribution of influencer-referred revenue to total YesStyle revenue also increased from
approximately 19.9% in 2022 to approximately 25.5% in 2023.
The number of influencers in the YesStyle Influencer Program grew from approximately 279,000 in 2022 to
approximately 333,000 in 2023. Notably, we observed a significant increase in TikTok influencers, with their
number growing from approximately 44,000 in 2022 to approximately 72,000 in 2023. We continue to encourage
creativity in our team, which launched many innovative social media campaigns to engage our vibrant influencer
communities.
Additionally, we have seen positive results from our loyalty program and CRM initiatives. Our loyalty program,
the YesStyle Elite Club, experienced substantial growth, with the number of members reaching approximately
11,617,000 by the end of 2023, compared to approximately 8,272,000 in 2022.
We leveraged our CRM system in 2023 to manage our growing loyalty program efficiently, offer personalized
shopping experiences, and increase member retention. For example, a new CRM journey was deployed
to promote newly arrival beauty products to customers with previously tracked interest. Similarly, another
CRM journey notifies customers when products they previously showed interest in are on sale. As a result of
these campaigns, CRM-assisted revenue grew from approximately US$14,892,000 in 2022 to approximately
US$26,023,000 in 2023, representing a growth of approximately 74.7%.

LOGISTICS UPDATE
We are continuously improving our fulfilment capabilities to achieve cost savings and operational efficiency. During
2023, we further enhanced the AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) system that we deployed the previous year.
The AMR system, together with its enhancements, significantly reduced labour costs as a percentage of revenue
from approximately 5.2% to approximately 3.5%. This reflects our team’s ability to execute and to achieve returns
on our technology-related investments. In addition, the AMR system received the 2022 Most Innovative Solutions
Award from Business Innovator, a business content media platform.

DIVIDEND
The Board declared a final dividend payment of HK5.0 cents per Share.

AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS
Our achievements in the Reporting Year have been recognized by the following awards and recognitions:

The Most Innovative E-Commerce Platform of the
Year Winner by Business Innovator

“Best Creative Shorts” award from the YouTube
Works Awards, Hong Kong 2023

HR Distinction Awards 2023: Gold Award for
Excellence in HR Digital Transformation, Silver Award
for HR Team of the Year, and Bronze Award for
Excellence in Learning & Development

Second runner-up in the 15km Corporate Relay
(Mixed Group) category at the
UNICEF Charity Run 2023

OUTLOOK
Looking ahead, we believe that YesAsia Holdings is well-positioned to capitalize on the continuing growth of
the global beauty market, particularly the K-Beauty segment. We plan to further expand our brand portfolio and
partnerships, enabling us to offer a wider range of new and high-quality products to our customers. Our focus
will be on strengthening our presence in key markets, such as the US, the UK, Canada and Europe, while also
exploring new growth opportunities in emerging markets.
Since early 2023, with the recovery of business and leisure travel after the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of
flights into and out of Hong Kong has risen significantly. We have observed that freight costs are trending down
along with an increase in overall cargo capacity.
During 2023, we continued to focus on cost-saving measures to keep our operations lean and agile. The AMR
system not only increased operational efficiency, it enabled us to fulfil the increasing number of customer orders
with less manpower. The total headcount of the Group was reduced from 489 at the end of 2022 to 454 at the
end of 2023, while we experienced an increase of over 50% in revenue.
The Group will continue to invest in its digital marketing strategies, and leverage on our influencers and social
media platforms to reach and engage with our target audience effectively. Furthermore, we will continue to
enhance our logistics capabilities to ensure efficient order processing and timely delivery, and continue providing
good customer experience.

If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.
Perseverance is a sign of willpower.
One who remains is one who endures.”
“知人者智，自知者明。勝人者有力，自勝者強。知足者富。強行者有志。不失其所者久。”
We hope 2024 brings good health, happiness and many blessings to you and your families.

90.1%, 143.4% and 38.6% respectively during the Reporting Year as compared to the Prior Year, revenue from
AsianBeautyWholesale during the Reporting Year rose to approximately US$38,788,000 (2022: US$11,601,000),
representing an increase of approximately 234.4% as compared to the Prior Year.
Products
During the Reporting Year, we continued to strengthen our competitive edge in the K-Beauty product market, by
partnering with 78 new K-Beauty brands with business potential to enrich our brand variety and taking down 60
brands with performance below expectation. As at the end of the Reporting Year, YesStyle partnered with 448
K-Beauty brands (2022: 430). The revenue contributed from beauty products as a percentage of the total revenue
increased from approximately 54.1% during the Prior Year to approximately 80.6% during the Reporting Year.
We continued to foster closer relationships with our K-Beauty partners. LG H&H Co., Ltd., a major South Korean
consumer goods company under LG Corporation, authorised us to distribute additional 14 LG brands during

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

YesStyle Influencer Program
The YesStyle Influencer Program showed strong growth during the Reporting Year. During the Reporting Year,
revenue generated from influencers’ referrals amounted to approximately US$40,422,000 (2022: US$21,901,000),
representing an increase of 84.6% as compared to the Prior Year, demonstrating the continuous success of the
YesStyle Influencer Program. Such contribution represented approximately 25.5% of revenue generated from
YesStyle (2022: 19.9%).
The number of influencers grew from approximately 279,000 at the end of 2022 to approximately 333,000 as at
31 December 2023, representing an increase of approximately 54,000 influencers.
We continued to partner with influencers to create interesting videos and posts on various platforms, including
Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, etc., which increased YesStyle’s exposure and referral revenue. In particular, the
total number of YesStyle TikTok Influencers continued to grow rapidly, from approximately 44,000 at the end of
2022 to approximately 72,000 at the end of 2023.
Customer Relationship Management System
Our CRM System continued to strengthen our targeted marketing and promotions during ad-hoc campaigns and
the peak season. During the Reporting Year, we enhanced our “welcome journey” by analyzing customers’ entry
point and product preference. Revenue facilitated by the CRM System amounted to approximately US$26,023,000
(2022: US$14,892,000), representing a growth of 74.7%.
The number of YesStyle loyalty program members increased to approximately 11,617,000 as at 31 December
2023 (2022: 8,272,000), representing an increase by approximately 40.4% during the Reporting Year.
YesStyle Student Program
The number of Generation Z students and members who have signed up reached approximately 98,000 by the
end of December 2023 (2022: 50,000), generating revenue of approximately US$5,145,000 during the Reporting
Year (2022: US$4,185,000).
Entertainment Products
For YesAsia, the revenue contributed from our entertainment products for the Reporting Year fell by approximately
48.8% as compared to the Prior Year. The decrease was mainly due to a lack of popular new releases during the
Reporting Year.
The Group has ceased its offline wholesale of entertainment products since January 2023 and has since
reallocated its resources to the development of its online platform business.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Logistics Services
The revenue contributed from our logistics services amounted to approximately US$1,178,000 during the
Reporting Year (2022: US$938,000).
Cost Saving Measures
During the Reporting Year, we have continued to monitor our expenditure growth. While we have devoted much
effort to support the expansion, the increase in total selling expenses and administrative expenses was much
lesser than the high revenue growth. Our selling expenses, excluding payment gateway charges, amounted to
approximately US$18,719,000 for the Reporting Year (2022: US$15,688,000), representing an increase of 19.3%.
Payment gateway charges for the Reporting Year increased by approximately 54.6% as compared to the Prior
Year, which was in line with the revenue growth.
In addition, our administrative expenses decreased to approximately US$29,577,000 during the Reporting Year
(2022: US$30,682,000), representing a decrease of approximately 3.6% as compared to the Prior Year. This was
the result of the decrease in depreciation of right-of-use assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment,
rates and management fee under administrative expenses due to (i) the non-renewal of certain leases of the
Group’s warehouses during the Prior Year upon expiry and consolidation of our warehouses to the Smart Robotics
Warehouse; and (ii) write-off of leasehold improvements for warehouses upon lease expiry.
With the continuous fine-tuning of the AMR system, the efficiency of our fulfillment is enhanced to cope with the
sales order growth and the AMR system brings in cost-saving benefits to our operations. The percentage of
outsourced warehouse labour charges and warehouse wages in aggregate to revenue (“Labour Cost Rate”)
was approximately 3.5% (Prior Year: 5.2%). We successfully achieved an annual savings of approximately
US$3,374,000 or 32.5% by deploying the AMR system.
Prospects
Consumer sentiment, which showed signs of improvement in early 2023, is expected to contribute to a more
resilient retail landscape. The online sales channels are poised to maintain their competitive advantages, leveraging
their ability to offer a diverse range of products at competitive prices and providing unparalleled convenience for
consumers to make purchases at any time.
The favorable economic developments, including the recent slowdown in the inflation rate in the US and the easing
of inflation in the United Kingdom and the European Union, are likely to bring relief to consumers in those regions.
While short-term economic uncertainties persist, the strengthened consumer sentiment towards long-term
economic recovery prospects is expected to bring positive impact on our business.
Moreover, demand for beauty products is expected to have a strong momentum of growth in the coming years.
We believe that the growing global K-Beauty product market remains an opportunity and a key driver to the
Group’s business.
In addition to initiatives aimed at boosting our top-line growth, we remain committed to robust cost management
strategies. Operational efficiency will continue to be one of the priorities for the Group’s revenue growth in the
coming years. We expect to leverage on cost-saving benefits due to the deployment of AMR in the Smart Robotics
Warehouse.
The Group will continue to adjust its strategies and review new business opportunities with the goal towards
improving Shareholders’ returns.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales of the Group during the Reporting Year was approximately US$138,641,000, representing an
increase of approximately US$52,775,000 or 61.5%, as compared to approximately US$85,866,000 during the
Prior Year. However, product costs as percentage of revenue increased by approximately 5.9 percentage points
to approximately 46.2% during the Reporting Year from approximately 40.3% in the Prior Year. This was mainly
because of the increase in the weighting of revenue from AsianBeautyWholesale which has a lower markup as it is
a wholesale business.

Our other income and other gains and losses decreased by approximately US$890,000 or 91.5% from
approximately US$973,000 during the Prior Year to approximately US$83,000 during the Reporting Year.
The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the absence of approximately US$632,000 of non-recurring
government subsidies income during the Reporting Year; (ii) the absence of approximately US$208,000 in gains
on remeasurement upon lease modification during the Reporting Year; (iii) approximately US$78,000 or 36.1%
increase in fair value loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; (iv) approximately US$73,000 or
90.1% decrease in reversal of provision on reinstatement costs; (v) approximately US$62,000 or 49.2% decrease
in cash rebates; and (vi) approximately US$30,000 or 62.5% decrease in dividend income, offset by approximately

The Group’s selling expenses during the Reporting Year were approximately US$23,908,000 (2022:
US$19,044,000), representing an increase of approximately US$4,864,000 or 25.5% as compared to that for
the Prior Year. Such increase was mainly attributable to (i) approximately US$2,527,000 or 35.7% increase
in marketing and promotion fees due to increase in beauty products-focused promotion; (ii) approximately
US$1,833,000 or 54.6% increase in payment gateway charges; (iii) approximately US$696,000 or 29.4% increase
in outsourced warehouse labour charges and (iv) approximately US$357,000 or 193.0% increase in custom duties

Administrative Expenses
The Group’s administrative expenses during the Reporting Year were approximately US$29,577,000 (2022:
US$30,682,000), representing a decrease by approximately US$1,105,000 or 3.6% as compared to that of the
corresponding period in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to (i) approximately US$883,000 or 16.1% decrease
in depreciation of right-of-use assets which benefited from the non-renewal of certain leases of the Group’s
warehouses during the Prior Year upon expiry and consolidation of our warehouses to the Smart Robotics
Warehouse; (ii) approximately US$409,000 or 2.4% decrease in staff costs as the number of administrative
employees reduced from 376 as at 31 December 2022 to 357 as at 31 December 2023; (iii) approximately
US$339,000 or 41.9% decrease in other administrative expenses due to absence of expenses related to moving
and preparation activities for the establishment of the Smart Robotics Warehouse during the Reporting Year;
(iv) approximately US$213,000 or 11.7% decrease in depreciation of property, plant and equipment due to the
write-off of leasehold improvements for warehouses upon lease expiry; (v) approximately US$210,000 or 14.3%
decrease in rates and management fee; and (vi) approximately US$91,000 or 8.4% decrease in utility expenses,
partially offset by (i) approximately US$889,000 or 140.0% increase in exchange losses, net due to more payments
settled by our payment gateway as a result of revenue increase during the Reporting Year; and (ii) approximately
US$93,000 or 80.2% increase in staff training and recruitment expenses resulted from more training programs
organized during the Reporting Year.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Finance Costs
The Group’s finance costs for the Reporting Year were approximately US$1,218,000 (2022: US$990,000),
representing an increase of approximately 23.0% as compared to that of the Prior Year, reflecting an increase in
interest on lease liabilities and provision for reinstatement costs for the new warehouse spaces leased during the
Reporting Year.
Income Tax Expense/(Credit)
Income tax expense for the Reporting Year was approximately US$510,000 (2022: US$233,000 credit). The
income tax expense during the Reporting Year was mainly due to increase in operating profit generated as
compared to that of the Prior Year.
Profit/(loss) for the Year
As a result of the foregoing, the Group recorded a net profit of approximately US$7,572,000 for the Reporting
Year, as compared with a net loss of approximately US$6,782,000 during the Prior Year. The increase in net profit
was mainly attributable to the increase in revenue by approximately US$72,747,000 or 56.6% during the Reporting
Year as compared to that in the Prior Year and thus increased the gross profit generated by approximately
US$19,972,000.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
During the Reporting Year, the Group acquired plant and equipment of approximately US$754,000 (2022:
US$4,436,000). The capital expenditure during the Reporting Year was mainly attributable to leasehold
improvements for the new warehouse leased during the Reporting Year and improvement in air-conditioning
system in the Group’s warehouse premises.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
During the Reporting Year, our principal source of liquidity was cash from operations and the net proceeds
from the Listing. As of 31 December 2023, the Group’s bank and cash balances amounted to approximately
US$25,181,000 (2022: US$18,797,000), which were mainly denominated in US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, South
Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling and Euro.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s bank and cash balances comprises (i) cash and cash equivalents of
approximately US$25,088,000 (2022: US$16,659,000); (ii) bank fixed deposits with original maturity beyond
three months of approximately US$93,000 (2022: US$2,121,000); and (iii) no restricted bank balances (2022:
US$17,000).

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

21

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Our cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately US$8,429,000 during the Reporting Year, which
was attributable to the net cash generated from operating activities of approximately US$8,992,000, the net
cash generated from investing activities of approximately US$1,381,000, offset by the net cash used in financing
activities of approximately US$1,952,000 and the positive effect of foreign exchange rate changes of approximately
US$8,000 during the year ended 31 December 2023.
Net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended 31 December 2023 was mainly due to (i)
operating profit before working capital changes of approximately US$15,789,000; (ii) approximately US$2,959,000
increase in trade and other payables and accruals; (iii) approximately US$3,344,000 increase in contract liabilities;
and (iv) approximately US$374,000 income taxes refunded, partially offset by (i) approximately US$9,220,000
increase in inventories; (ii) approximately US$2,526,000 increase in trade receivables; (iii) approximately
US$1,144,000 interest on lease liabilities paid; (iv) approximately US$389,000 increase in prepayments, deposits
and other receivables; and (iv) approximately US$195,000 decrease in provisions.
Net cash generated from investing activities during the year ended 31 December 2023 was mainly due to (i)
approximately US$2,028,000 decrease in bank fixed deposits with original maturity beyond three months; (ii)
approximately US$123,000 interest received; and (iii) approximately US$17,000 decrease in restricted bank
balance, partially offset by (i) approximately US$754,000 property, plant and equipment purchased mainly for the
newly leased warehouse’s leasehold improvements during the Reporting Year and improvement in air-conditioning
system in the Group’s warehouse premises; and (ii) approximately US$33,000 deposits paid for property, plant
and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to approximately US$3,966,000 repayment of principal
elements of lease payments, partially offset by (i) approximately US$92,000 of proceeds from issuance of shares;
and (ii) approximately US$1,922,000 decrease in pledged bank fixed deposits during the Reporting Year.
Our bank fixed deposits with original maturity beyond three months decreased by US$2,028,000 during the
Reporting Year as compared to that in the Prior Year, to increase liquidity in supporting the Group’s operation
during the Reporting Year.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had no bank borrowing (2022: Nil).
We believe that our liquidity requirements and our expected source of funding in the coming year will be satisfied
by using the cash generated from our operations.

TREASURY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES
The Group’s treasury management policy is to avoid any investment in highly-leveraged or speculative derivative
products. The Group continued to be conservative in managing financial risk during the Reporting Year. Consistent
with the aforesaid treasury objectives and policy, the Group undertakes treasury management activities with
respect to its surplus cash assets. The selection criteria of investments include the relative risk profile involved, the
liquidity of an investment, the after-tax-equivalent yield of an investment and investments that are not speculative in
nature.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Most business transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group were denominated either in US Dollar, Hong
Kong Dollar, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling and Euro. The E-commerce customers
of the Group generally settle their invoices using their designated currencies upon checkout via secure payment
gateways, and the fund is generally transferred to the Group’s account in Hong Kong Dollar and US Dollar upon
currency conversion. As Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to US Dollar, our Group does not expect any significant
movements in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars. Besides, our Group has certain
exposure to foreign currency risk as some of our business transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in
currencies (i.e. South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Euro, etc) other than the
functional currency of our Group (i.e. US Dollar).
Currently, we do not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy. However, our management monitors foreign
exchange exposure constantly and will consider to engage in derivatives markets or foreign exchange hedging
measures to minimize the foreign exchange risk when it is foreseen to be significant.

GEARING RATIO
Our gearing ratio, calculated by total interest-bearing liabilities (including lease liabilities) divided by total equity,
decreased from approximately 57.0% as at 31 December 2022 to approximately 34.8% as at 31 December 2023,
primarily due to the decrease in lease liabilities and the increase in total equity due to net profit of approximately
US$7,572,000 for the Reporting Year.

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Save for those disclosed in note 38 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group did not have any significant
capital commitments as at 31 December 2023.

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELD
During the Reporting Year, we did not hold any significant investments, save for the 1,100,000 shares in CN
Logistics, representing approximately 0.4% of the issued share capital of CN Logistics with a fair value amounted
to approximately US$863,000 as at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$1,191,000). The investment represents
approximately 1.2% of the total consolidated asset of the Group as at 31 December 2023 (2022: 1.9%). The
aforementioned 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics were subscribed by the Company at a total cash consideration
of HK$10,120,000. The principal activity of CN Logistics is investment holding, and through its subsidiaries,
principally engages in the provision of air freight forwarding services and distribution and logistics services in
relation to fashion products and fine wine, primarily focusing on high-end fashion (including luxury and affordable
luxury) products. CN Logistics is a strategic logistics partner of the Group for delivery of our customers’ products
to the US, Europe and other overseas markets.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

23

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

As at 31 December 2023, the unrealised fair value loss of such investment was approximately US$328,000 due to
the decrease in share price in CN Logistics during the Reporting Year from the carrying value as at 31 December
2022. We have received dividend of approximately US$18,000 from the investment during the Reporting Year.

business growth. According to the Board Diversity Policy, the Company seeks to achieve diversity of the Board
through the consideration of a number of factors when selecting candidates to the Board, including but not
limited to gender, age, cultural and educational background, ethnicity, professional experience, skills, knowledge
and length of service. The existing members of the Board were appointed after taking into account the aforesaid
factors. All Directors, including independent non-executive Directors, have brought a wide spectrum of valuable
business experience, knowledge and professionalism to the Board for its efficient and effective functioning.
Independent non-executive Directors are invited to serve on the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee
and the Nomination Committee.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is overall responsible for evaluating and determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to
take in achieving the Group’s strategic objectives, and ensures that the Group has established and maintained
appropriate and effective risk management and internal control systems. A sound risk management and internal
control system aims to reduce the risks faced by the Group in the process of achieving various business goals and
to provide reasonable but not absolute guarantees for the realization of business goals.
The Audit Committee reviews the risk management and internal controls that are significant to the Group on an
on-going basis. The Audit Committee would consider the adequacy of resources, qualifications, experience and
training of staff and external advisors of the Group’s accounting and financial reporting departments. The Company
convened meetings with the Audit Committee periodically to discuss financial, operational and compliance controls
and risk management functions. Moreover, the Audit Committee assists the Board in leading the management and
overseeing their design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and internal control systems.
The management of the Group is responsible for designing, maintaining, implementing and monitoring the risk
management and internal control systems to ensure adequate control is in place to safeguard the Group’s assets
and stakeholder’s interest. Management also assists the Board in the implementation of the Group’s policies,
procedures and controls by identifying and assessing the risks faced, and in the design, operation and monitoring
of suitable internal controls to mitigate and control these risks.
Our Board has established the risk and compliance committee (“Risk and Compliance Committee”), which
comprises Mr. Lau, Ms. Chu and Mr. Chu, all of whom are executive Directors. The Risk and Compliance
Committee oversees our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance, management approach and
strategy. The Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for establishing, adopting, and reviewing our ESG
policies, and evaluates ESG-related risks (including risks to the Group’s businesses) on an annual basis.

management and internal control systems are designed to mitigate the potential losses and adverse impact to our
business and protect the Shareholders’ interests.

The management would identify the risks associated with the business of the Group by considering both internal
and external factors and events which include politics, economy, technology, environmental, social and staff. Each
of the risks has been assessed and prioritised based on their relevant impact and chance of occurrence. The
relevant risk management strategies would be applied to each type of risks according to the assessment results.
Types of risk management strategies are listed as follow:
–

Risk retention and reduction: accept the impact of risk or undertake actions by the Group to reduce the
impact of the risk;

–

Risk avoidance: change business process or objective so as to avoid risk;

–

Risk sharing and diversification: diversify the effect of risk or allocate to different locations or products or
markets;

–

Risk transfer: transfer ownership and liability to a third party.

The internal control systems are designed and implemented to reduce the risks associated with the business
accepted by the Group and minimize the adverse impact resulting from the risks. The risk management and
internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

systems of the Group, including financial, operational and compliance risks and the respective risk mitigation
activities, during the Reporting Year.
BTCGL has prepared the internal audit report and presented to the Group’s management and operational teams
for their attention and appropriate actions. Remedial actions have been developed collaboratively by the Group’s

of the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Procedures have been designed for safeguarding assets against
unauthorised use or disposition, ensuring the maintenance of proper accounting records for the provision of

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The E-commerce industry is highly competitive and the Group may not compete successfully against new and
existing competitors, which may materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial conditions and results of
operations
The E-commerce industry is subject to intense competition, which is particularly true with respect to the Group’s
core business, being the online retail of fashion & lifestyle, beauty and entertainment products. The Group faces a
variety of competitive challenges, including:
•

sourcing products efficiently and economically;

•

identifying new and emerging brands and maintaining relationships with those brands or their business
partners;

•

competing for and retaining high quality suppliers;

•

pricing of products competitively;

•

facilitate efficient and economic warehousing, fulfillment and delivery arrangement;

•

maintaining the quality of services;

•

anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer demands and preferences;

•

developing new features to enhance the customer experience on the Group’s platforms;

•

international markets expansion;

•

acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers;

•

conducting effective marketing activities and maintaining favorable recognition of the Group’s brands,
websites and products; and

•

navigating the rapidly evolving IT system.

If the Group cannot properly address these challenges, the Group’s business and prospects would be materially
and adversely affected. In addition, factors beyond the Group’s control such as imposition of or increase in taxes
or tariffs, fluctuations of exchange rates or general economic downturns could also lower the Group’s profitability
under the competition pressure.
As a mitigating measure, the Group continues to launch new marketing initiatives to recruit new members and
enhance the shopping experience for customers and loyalty by deployment of a new customer relationship
management system. With the use of data analytics, the Group can provide more customized content that helps
the Group to expand customers base.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

The Group uses third-party couriers to deliver orders. If these couriers fail to provide reliable delivery services at
commercially acceptable terms, the Group’s business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected
The Group delivers goods through major local and international courier companies. Interruptions to or failures in
these third parties’ delivery services could inhibit the timely or proper delivery of the goods to customers. Service
rates with these third party service providers may fluctuate. If these third-party couriers fail to deliver the goods
in time or at all, or at uncompetitive costs, the Group may not be able to find alternative delivery companies to
provide delivery services in a timely and cost efficient manner, or at all. If the goods are not delivered in proper
condition or on a timely basis to our customers under a reasonable cost, the Group’s business, prospects or
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
As a mitigating measure, on 29 November 2021, the Group entered into a memorandum of understanding with
CN Logistics, pursuant to which CN Logistics would offer logistics services for the Group’s delivery of products
in the United States and Europe and other overseas markets at charging rates which are expected to be at least
10% lower than the best available quotation by other independent service providers received and maintained by
the Group on a regular basis. The Group believes the cooperation would enable the Group to offer more shipping
options to customers and to attract more traffic to the online platforms maintained by the Group.
The financial risk factors are set out in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Key Relationships with Employees, Customers and Suppliers
The Group has always paid great attention to and maintained a good business relationship with its suppliers of
products and services, and has been providing, quality professional and customer-oriented services for its regional
markets and customers. Suppliers and customers are good business partners creating value for the Group.
The Group also values the knowledge and skills of its employees, and continues to provide favourable career
development opportunities for its employees.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE
The Group is committed to the environmental protection principle for delivering sustainable value to our
stakeholders and have set out various initiatives aiming at the control of paper waste during our operations. The
Group has not noted any material non-compliance with the relevant laws and regulations in relation to its business
covering health and safety, workplace conditions, employment and the environment aspects during the Reporting
Year. The Group has established its environmental, social and governance policies which set forth environmental
protection measures, social responsibility principles and internal governance policies, and the Board has reviewed
and confirmed its satisfaction with the implementation effectiveness and performance of such policies during
the Reporting Year. The environmental, social and governance report of the Company for the year ended 31
December 2023 is available on the Company’s website at https://www.yesasiaholdings.com and the Hong Kong
Exchanges and Clearing Limited’s website at https://www.hkexnews.hk. Going forward, the Group will review
its environmental practices from time to time and will consider implementing further eco-friendly measures and
practices in the Group’s daily operation and continue to promote environmental practices and social sustainability.

However, the terms of the 2005 Share Option Scheme allow the options to have a maximum exercise period of
ten (10) years from the date of grant of the respective options and the all outstanding options granted prior to the
expiration of the scheme would remain effective, and the expiration of the 2005 Share Option Scheme would not
result in the termination of any options already granted.
There is no maximum entitlement of each participant specified under the 2005 Share Option Scheme. The exercise
price of options granted under the 2005 Share Option Scheme shall be determined by the Board but shall not be
less than 85% of the fair market value of the Shares as at the grant date.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

Post-IPO Share Option Scheme
A post-IPO share option scheme was adopted by the Company on 13 March 2021, which was conditional upon
the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange and came into effect on 9 July 2021 (the “Post-IPO Share
Option Scheme”). The Post-IPO Share Option Scheme shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years
from the date of the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange until 8 July 2031. The purpose of the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company
to attract and retain qualified employees or directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries through providing
them with an opportunity for investment in the shares of the Company. Participants to the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme include any individual, being an employee or director of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries
who the Board or its delegate(s) considers, in their sole discretion, to have contributed or will contribute to
the business performance of the Group. However, no individual who is a resident in a place where the grant,
acceptance or exercise of options pursuant to the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is not permitted under the laws
and regulations of such place or where, in the view of the Board or its delegate(s), compliance with applicable laws
and regulations in such place makes it necessary or expedient to exclude such individual from the grant or offer of
such options.
The total number of Shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options that could be granted under
the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is 39,539,079, being 10% of the Shares in issue on the date the Shares
commence trading on the Stock Exchange (the “Option Scheme Mandate Limit”) (excluding any Shares which
may be issued pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Pre-IPO Share Option
Schemes). Options which have lapsed in accordance with the terms of the rules of the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme (or any other share option schemes of the Company) shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating
the Option Scheme Mandate Limit.
Unless approved by the Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of
the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme and any other share option
scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised and outstanding options) in
any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any
further grant of options to a selected participant which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued
and to be issued upon exercise of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including
exercised, canceled and outstanding options) in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such
further grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of the Shareholders (with such
selected participant and his close associates abstaining from voting). There was no option granted under such
circumstances during the Reporting Year.
Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

The subscription price, being the amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option, in the
event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall be not less than the greater of:
(i)

the closing price of a Share as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock Exchange on the
date of grant;

(ii)

the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and

(iii)

the nominal value of a Share on the date of grant.

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no grantee shall in any way
sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or create any interest in favor of or enter into
any agreement with any other person over or in relation to any option.
Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the Company (or any of
their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent non-executive Directors (excluding any
independent non-executive Director who is a proposed recipient of the grant of options).
In addition, where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive Director
of the Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of Shares issued and to be
issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted (including options exercised, canceled and
outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such grant:
(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii)

having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets
issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess of HK$5,000,000 (or such other higher
amount as may from time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way of poll) in a general
meeting. In obtaining the approval, the Company shall send a circular to the Shareholders in accordance with and
containing such information as is required under the Listing Rules. All core connected persons of the Company
shall abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any core connected person may vote against the
relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been stated in the circular to be
sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith. There was no option granted under such circumstances during
the Reporting Year.

EMOLUMENT POLICY
The Remuneration Committee is set up for reviewing the Group’s emolument policy and structure for all

TO THE MEMBERS OF
YESASIA HOLDINGS LIMITED
(Incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

OPINION
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of YesAsia Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 78 to 152, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial
position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including
material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued
by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the “HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in
compliance with the Companies Ordinance.

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with
the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the “Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matter we identified is:
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition of revenue generated from selfoperated online platform

Our procedures in relation to the recognition of
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
included:

We identified recognition of revenue generated from
self-operated online platform as a key audit matter
as the relevant sales transactions were conducted
through the Group’s self-operated online platform from
receiving the sales orders to arranging the delivery
and the total revenue amount and volume involved
are significant. The recognition of such revenue is
highly dependent on data flow accuracy of and the
IT controls over the online platform. Hence, it gives
rise to an inherent risk that such revenue could be
misstated or subject to manipulation.
The Group’s revenue generated from self-operated
online platform is recognised when the ordered
goods are delivered or picked up, being the time
when customers obtain control over the goods. The
accounting policy for revenue recognition and related
performance obligations are disclosed in Note 4(m)
and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements,
respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2023,
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
amounted to US$200,156,000, represented 99.4% of
the Group’s total revenue, which is set out in Note 8
to the consolidated financial statements.

•

Obtaining an understanding of and assessing
the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of key internal controls which
govern such revenue recognition;

•

Engaging our internal IT specialists to obtain
an understanding of and assessing the design,
implementation and operating effectiveness of
general IT controls for relevant IT applications
and IT application controls which govern such
revenue recognition;

•

Engaging our internal IT specialists to assist
us in testing the data flow accuracy and
assessing the operating effectiveness of those
IT application controls which are relevant to the
recognition of revenue;

•

Understanding the terms of delivery of the sales
orders and assessing whether the management
of the Group recognised the revenue in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy
and when Group’s performance obligations are
satisfactorily fulfilled;

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition of revenue generated from selfoperated online platform (continued)

Our procedures in relation to the recognition of
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
included: (continued)
•

Checking the supporting documents for
recognition of the revenue including sales
invoices, good delivery notes and/or evidence
of the customers’ acknowledgement of receipt
of the goods on the self-operated online
platform, on a sample basis;

•

Obtaining audit confirmations to confirm the
sales transaction amounts from customers,
on a sample basis, and performing alternative
procedures for unreturned confirmations; and

•

Performing data analysis to identity unusual
pattern and fluctuation of revenue generated
from self-operated online platform and
obtaining explanation from the management of
the Group together with checking the relevant
supporting documents.

OTHER INFORMATION
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information
included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Companies Ordinance, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee assists the directors in discharging their responsibilities for overseeing the Group’s financial
reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 405 of the Companies
Ordinance and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other
person for the contents of this report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

75

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

76

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Group’s internal control.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the directors.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible
for our audit opinion.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2023

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards
applied.
From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
key audit matter. We describe this matter in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Ms. Ng Wai Kwun.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless
mentioned otherwise in the accounting policies below (e.g. certain financial instruments that are measured
at fair value).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgements in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The area involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise
stated.
(a)

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and
its subsidiaries made up to 31 December. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has
control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
entity. The Group has power over an entity when the Group has existing rights that give it the current
ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns.
When assessing control, the Group considers its potential voting rights as well as potential voting
rights held by other parties. A potential voting right is considered only if the holder has the practical
ability to exercise that right.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date the control ceases.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised profits are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly,
to the Company. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial
position and consolidated statement of changes in equity within equity. Non-controlling interests are
presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income as an allocation of profit or loss and total comprehensive income
for the year between the non-controlling shareholders and owners of the Company.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners
of the Company and to the non-controlling shareholders even if this results in the non-controlling
interests having a deficit balance.

(b)

Separate financial statements
In the Company’s statement of financial position, an investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost less
impairment loss, unless the investment is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group
that is classified as held for sale). Cost includes direct attributable costs of investments. The results
of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividend received or receivable.
Impairment testing of the investments in subsidiaries is required upon receiving a dividend from
these investments if the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the
period the dividend is declared or if the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial
statements exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s
net assets including goodwill.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(c)

Foreign currency translation
(i)

Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the
“functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US$, which is
the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

(ii)

Transactions and balances in each entity’s financial statements
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency on initial
recognition using the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the end of each
reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from this translation policy are recognised in profit
or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
currency are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. The
transaction date is the date on which the entity initially recognises such non-monetary assets
or liabilities. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currencies are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates when the fair values are determined.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income,
any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange
component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

(iii)

Translation on consolidation
The results and financial position of all foreign operations (none of which has the currency
of hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Company’s
presentation currency are translated into the Company’s presentation currency as follows:
–

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at
the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;

–

Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated
at the exchange rates on the transaction dates); and

–

All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of monetary items that
form part of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation
is sold, such exchange differences are reclassified to consolidated profit or loss as part of the
gain or loss on disposal.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(d)

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or
for administrative purposes. Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement
of financial position at cost, less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance
are recognised in profit or loss during the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment are calculated at rates sufficient to write off their cost
less their residual values over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The principal useful
lives are as follows:
Leasehold improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Computer software and equipment
Motor vehicles

Over the lease term
5 years
3–5 years
5 years

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate,
at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a
prospective basis.
The gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment are the difference between the net
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.
(e)

Leases
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset
for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is conveyed where the customer has
both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic
benefits from that use.
Where the contract contains lease component(s) and non-lease component(s), the Group has
elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for each lease component and any
associated non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(e)

Leases (Continued)
At the lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability,
except for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value
assets. When the Group enters into a lease in respect of a low-value asset, the Group decides
whether to capitalise the lease on a lease-by-lease basis. The lease payments associated with those
leases which are not capitalised are recognised as an expense in a systematic basis over the lease
term.
Where the lease is capitalised, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease
payments payable over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
that rate cannot be readily determined, using a relevant incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments
to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the
lease liability. After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost and interest
expense is calculated using the effective interest method.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement
of the lease liability and hence are charged to profit or loss in the accounting period in which they are
incurred.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:
•

uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for
leases held by the individual lessee, which does not have recent third-party financing, and

•

makes adjustments specific to the lease including term, country, currency and security.

If a readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent
financing or market data) which has a similar payment profile to the lease, then the individual lessee
uses that rate as a starting point to determine the incremental borrowing rate.
The right-of-use asset recognised when a lease is capitalised is initially measured at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability plus any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred. Where applicable, the cost of the rightof-use assets also includes an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to
restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, discounted to their present value, less
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(e)

Leases (Continued)
Right-of-use assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying
leased assets at the end of the lease term are depreciated from commencement date to the end of
the useful life. Otherwise, right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
When the Group obtains ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term,
upon exercising purchase options, the cost of the relevant right-of-use assets and the related
accumulated depreciation are transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value.
Adjustments to fair value at initial recognition are considered as additional lease payments and
included in the cost of right-of-use assets.
The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in the scope of a lease or the consideration
for a lease that is not originally provided for in the lease contract (“lease modification”) that is not
accounted for as a separate lease. In this case the lease liability is remeasured based on the revised
lease payments and lease term using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

(f)

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the
weighted average basis and comprises costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(g)

Contract assets and contract liabilities
Contract asset is recognised when the Group recognises revenue before being unconditionally
entitled to the consideration under the payment terms set out in the contract. Contract assets
are assessed for expected credit losses (“ECL”) in accordance with the policy set out in Note 4(s)
to the consolidated financial statements and are reclassified to receivables when the right to the
consideration has become unconditional.
A contract liability is recognised when the customer pays consideration before the Group recognises
the related revenue. A contract liability would also be recognised if the Group has an unconditional
right to receive consideration before the Group recognises the related revenue. In such cases, a
corresponding receivable would also be recognised.
The Group operates a loyalty programme which awards customers membership to enjoy certain
discount on future purchases. The programme gives rise to a separate performance obligation
because it provides a material right to the customers. A portion of the transaction price is allocated
to the customers based on relative stand-alone selling price and are recognised as contract liabilities.
For a single contract with the customer, either a net contract asset or a net contract liability is
presented. For multiple contracts, contract assets and contract liabilities of unrelated contracts are
not presented on a net basis.
When the contract includes a significant financing component, the contract balance includes interest
accrued under the effective interest method.

(h)

Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial
position when the Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other
than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from
the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the
Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the
Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for
the proceeds received.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(h)

Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments (Continued)
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

(i)

Financial assets
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade
date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require
delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or
fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Debt investments
Debt investments held by the Group are classified into one of the following measurement categories:
–

amortised cost, if the investment is held for the collection of contractual cash flows which
represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from the investment is
calculated using the effective interest method.

–

Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) – recycling, if the contractual cash
flows of the investment comprise solely payments of principal and interest and the investment
is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both the collection of
contractual cash flows and sale. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive
income, except for the recognition in profit or loss of ECL, interest income (calculated using
the effective interest method) and foreign exchange gains and losses. When the investment
is derecognised, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is recycled from
equity to profit or loss.

–

FVTPL, if the investment does not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost
or FVTOCI (recycling). Changes in the fair value of the investment (including interest) are
recognised in profit or loss.

Equity investments
An investment in equity securities is classified as FVTPL unless the equity investment is not held
for trading purposes and on initial recognition of the investment the Group makes an election to
designate the investment at FVTOCI (non-recycling) such that subsequent changes in fair value are
recognised in other comprehensive income. Such elections are made on an instrument-by-instrument
basis, but may only be made if the investment meets the definition of equity from the issuer’s
perspective. Where such an election is made, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive
income remains in the fair value reserve (non-recycling) until the investment is disposed of. At the
time of disposal, the amount accumulated in the fair value reserve (non-recycling) is transferred to
accumulated losses. It is not recycled through profit or loss. Dividends from an investment in equity
securities, irrespective of whether classified as at FVTPL or FVTOCI, are recognised in profit or loss as
other income.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(j)

Trade and other receivables
A receivable is recognised when the Group has an unconditional right to receive consideration. A
right to receive consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment
of that consideration is due. If revenue has been recognised before the Group has an unconditional
right to receive consideration, the amount is presented as a contract asset.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless
they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group
holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore
measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less allowance
for credit losses.

(k)

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits with banks and
other financial institutions, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, having
been within three months of maturity at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are assessed for
ECL.

(l)

Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument under
HKFRSs. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial
liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
(i)

Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the effect of discounting would
be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost.

(ii)

Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

(m)

Revenue and other income
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents
amounts receivable for the E-commerce transactions and offline wholesale of products, stated net of
value added taxes, sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts.
Revenue is recognised when specific criteria have been met for the Group’s activity described below:
(i)

Sale of goods – E-commerce transactions
The Group sells products through E-commerce platforms. Revenue from the sale of goods
is recognised on a trade date basis when the relevant transactions are executed and there
is no unfulfilled obligation that affect the customer’s acceptance of the goods sold. Payment
of the transaction price is due immediately when the customer purchases the goods. As part
of the Group’s ordinary activities for the E-commerce transactions, discount coupons and
credit points are issued and granted to customers, and the receipts in respect of which are
deferred and recognised as “contract liabilities” on the consolidated statement of financial
position. Any non-redeemed discount coupons and points are referred to as breakage. An
expected breakage amount in receipts in advance is determined by historical experience and is
recognised as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemptions by the customers.
The Group estimates the sales return provision based on accumulated experience.

(ii)

Sale of goods – Offline wholesale
Sales are recognised when control of the products has transferred, being at the point the
goods have been shipped in accordance with the terms of contract, to the wholesaler. The
wholesaler has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no
unfulfilled obligation that affects the wholesaler’s acceptance of the products.
The goods are often sold with sales discounts. Revenue from these sales is recognised
based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts, if any. No
element of financing is deemed present.

(iii)

Customer loyalty programme
The Group operates a customer loyalty programme, where certain customers accumulate
points for purchases made which entitle them to purchase goods at certain discounts on
future purchases. The customer loyalty programme gives rise to a separate performance
obligation because it provides a material right to the customer and allocates a portion of the
transaction price to the loyalty credits awarded to customers based on the relative standalone selling price. The amount allocated to the loyalty programme is recognised as a contract
liability, and revenue is recognised when the rewards are redeemed or expire.

Revenue and other income (Continued)
Revenue is recognised when specific criteria have been met for the Group’s activity described below:
(Continued)
(iv)

Others
Shipping revenue is recognised over time when the service is performed.
Income from store credits is recognised when the store credit is expired and unused.
Logistic income generated from logistics and ancillary services are recognised over time when
the services are performed.
Consignment sales represents income earned for goods consigned to the Group and is
recognised when the control of consigned goods transferred to the customer.
Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment are
established.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method. For financial
assets measured at amortised cost that are not credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is
applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset. For credit impaired financial assets, the
effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount net of loss
allowance) of the asset.

(n)

Employee benefits
(i)

Employee leave entitlements
Employee entitlements to annual leave and long service leave are recognised when they
accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave and long
service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting
period.
Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of
leave.

(ii)

Pension obligations
The Group contributes to defined contribution retirement schemes which are available to all
employees. Contributions to the schemes by the Group and employees are calculated as a
percentage of employees’ basic salaries. The retirement benefit scheme cost charged to profit
or loss represents contributions payable by the Group to the funds.

(iii)

Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised at the earlier of the dates when the Group can no longer
withdraw the offer of those benefits, and when the Group recognises restructuring costs and
involves the payment of termination benefits.

(o)

Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to directors and employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments to directors and employees are measured at the fair value
(excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) of the equity instruments at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
When the share options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net
of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share
premium respectively.

(p)

Government grants
A government grant is recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply
with the conditions attaching to it and that the grant will be received.
Government grants relating to income are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period to
match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.
Government grants that become receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred
or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.

(q)

Taxation
Income tax represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit
recognised in profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised. Such assets and
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit and at
the time of transaction does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred
tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would
follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(q)

Taxation (Continued)
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognises
the right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax
deductions are attributable to the right-of-use assets or the lease liabilities.
For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group
applies HKAS 12 requirements to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately. The Group
recognises a deferred tax asset related to lease liabilities to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised and a
deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis,
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(r)

Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date for indications
of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down as an expense through the
consolidated statement of profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is
the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal of the individual asset or the cashgenerating unit.
Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the asset/cash-generating unit.
Present values are computed using pre-tax discount rates that reflect the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset/cash-generating unit whose impairment is being measured.
Impairment losses for cash-generating units are allocated pro rata amongst the assets of the cashgenerating unit. Subsequent increases in the recoverable amount caused by changes in estimates
are credited to profit or loss to the extent that they reverse the impairment.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for ECL on trade receivables and contract assets. The
amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial
recognition of the respective financial instrument.
The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables and contract assets. The ECL on
these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit
loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions
and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting
date, including time value of money where appropriate.
For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial
instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss
allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.
Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected
life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is
expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months
after the reporting date.
Significant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the
reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial
recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative
information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking
information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered
includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from
economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other
similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast
economic information that relate to the Group’s core operations.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets (Continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (Continued)
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has
increased significantly since initial recognition:
–

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available)
or internal credit rating;

–

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial
instrument;

–

existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are
expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

–

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

–

significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; or

–

an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological
environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet
its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on
a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are
more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that
demonstrates otherwise.
Despite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not
increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low
credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if:
(i)

the financial instrument has a low risk of default,

(ii)

the debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near
term, and

(iii)

adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not
necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets (Continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (Continued)
The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when the asset has external credit
rating of “investment grade” in accordance with the globally understood definition or if an external
rating is not available, the asset has an internal rating of “performing”. Performing means that the
counterparty has a strong financial position and there are no past due amounts.
The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been
a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are
capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.
Definition of default
The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk
management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the
following criteria are generally not recoverable.
–

when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

–

information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor
is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any
collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial
asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information
to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets (Continued)
Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the
estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is
credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:
–

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the counterparty;

–

a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

–

the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the
counterparty’s financial difficulty, having granted to the counterparty a concession(s) that the
lender(s) would not otherwise consider;

–

it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial
reorganisation; or

–

the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.

Write-off policy
The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, including when the debtor
has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case
of trade receivables, when the amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner.
Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised
in profit or loss.
Measurement and recognition of ECL
The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the
magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the
probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward
looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is
represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date.
For financial assets, the ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that
are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects
to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

(s)

Impairment of financial assets and contract assets (Continued)
Measurement and recognition of ECL (Continued)
If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the
conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount
equal to 12-month ECL at the current reporting date, except for assets for which simplified approach
was used.
The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a
corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.

(t)

Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be
made. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the
expenditures expected to settle the obligation. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as
interest expense.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot
be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of
outflow is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more future events are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the
probability of outflow is remote.

(u)

Events after the reporting period
Events after the reporting period that provide additional information about the Group’s position at the
end of the reporting period or those that indicate the going concern assumption is not appropriate
are adjusting events and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Events after the
reporting period that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements when material.

CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY ESTIMATES
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 4, the directors are required to
make judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts
recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period,
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
(a)

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
In the process of applying the accounting policies, the directors have made the following judgements
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Determining the lease term
In determining the lease term at the commencement date for leases that include renewal options
exercisable by the Group, the Group evaluates the likelihood of exercising the renewal options taking
into account all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group
to exercise the option, including favourable terms, leasehold improvements undertaken and the
importance of that underlying asset to the Group’s operation.
The lease term is reassessed when there is a significant event or significant change in circumstance
that is within the Group’s control. Any increase or decrease in the lease term would affect the
amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised in the future years. During the current
financial year, no lease term has been reassessed.

(b)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
(i)

Customer loyalty programme
The allocation of the transaction price to the customer loyalty programme requires estimates
of the relative stand-alone selling price. Where the actual outcome is different from the original
estimate, such difference will impact the carrying amount of deferred revenue and profit or
loss in the subsequent period.
The carrying amount of deferred revenue in respect of customer loyalty programme as at 31
December 2023 was US$2,288,000 (2022: US$624,000).

(b)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)
(ii)

Share-based payments
The fair value of the share options granted to the directors and employees determined at
the date of grant of the respective share options is expensed over the vesting period, with a
corresponding adjustment to the Group’s share-based payments reserve. In assessing the
fair value of the share options, Binomial Option pricing model was used. The Binomial Option
pricing model is one of the generally accepted methodologies used to calculate the fair value
of the share options. The Binomial Option pricing model requires the input of assumptions,
including the share price, risk free rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and
expected life of options. Any changes in these assumptions can significantly affect the estimate
of the fair value of the share options.
The carrying amount of share-based payments reserve as at 31 December 2023 was
US$2,740,000 (2022: US$2,562,000).

(iii)

Allowance for slow-moving inventories and net realisable value of inventories
Allowance for slow-moving inventories is made based on the ageing and estimated net
realisable value of inventories. The assessment of the allowance amount involves judgement
and estimates. Where the actual outcome in future is different from the original estimate, such
difference will impact the carrying value of inventories and allowance charge/writeback in the
period in which such estimate has been changed. As at 31 December 2023, the carrying
amount of inventories was US$20,849,000 (net of allowance for inventories of US$786,000)
(2022: US$11,897,000 (net of allowance for inventories of US$518,000)).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: foreign currency risk, price risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance.
(a)

Foreign currency risk
The Group has certain exposure to foreign currency risk as most of its business transactions, assets
and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group entities
such as Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), South Korean Won (“KRW”), Japanese Yen (“JPY”), British
Pound Sterling (“GBP”) and Euro (“EUR”). As US$ is pegged to HK$, the Group does not expect any
significant movements in the US$/HK$ exchange rate.
The Group currently does not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy but will consider hedging
significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise.
Sensitivity analysis
The following table indicates the approximate change in the Group’s profit/(loss) for the year in
response to reasonably possible changes in the foreign exchange rates of KRW, JPY, GBP and
EUR to which the Group has significant exposure at the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity
analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period has been
determined based on the exchange rate fluctuation at the beginning and the end of the year.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(a)

Foreign currency risk (Continued)
The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to currency risk at the reporting date has been
determined based on the hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates which are commensurate
with historical fluctuation during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022. The assumed
changes represent management’s assessment of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange
rates over the year until the next reporting date.

(b)

Price risk
The management of the Company manages its price risk’s exposure by maintaining a portfolio
of investments with different risk and return profiles. The Group’s equity price risk is mainly
concentrated on equity security quoted on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at
the end of the reporting period.
If equity prices had been 10% higher/lower, profit/(loss) after tax for the year ended 31 December
2023 would increase/decrease (2022: decrease/increase) by US$86,000 (2022: US$119,000). This is
solely due to the change in fair value of the share price.

(c)

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks
and financial institutions.
(i)

Credit risk of deposits with banks and financial institutions
As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, all bank balances and bank deposits are held at
reputable financial institutions and there is no significant concentration risk to a single
counterparty and there is no history of defaults from these counterparties. The ECL is close to
zero.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(c)

Credit risk (Continued)
(ii)

Credit risk of trade receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics
of each customer rather than the industry or country in which the customers operate and
therefore significant concentrations of credit risk primarily arise when the Group has significant
exposure to individual customers. The Group’s largest customer shared nearly 1.9% and
0.6% of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 respectively. The Group has
policies and procedures to monitor the collection of the trade receivables to limit the exposure
to the non-recovery of the receivables and there is no recent history of default for the Group’s
largest customer.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established
policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Individual credit
evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. These
evaluations focus on the customer’s past history of making payments when due and current
ability to pay, and take into account information specific to the customer as well as pertaining
to the economic environment in which the customer operates. Trade receivables generally
are due within three months after the date of billing. Debtors with balances that are more than
one month past due are requested to settle all outstanding balances before any further credit is
granted. Normally, the Group does not obtain collateral from customers.
The Group measures loss allowances for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime
ECLs, which is calculated using a provision matrix. As the Group’s historical credit loss
experience does not indicate significantly different loss patterns for different customer
segments, the loss allowance based on past due status is not further distinguished between
the Group’s different customer bases. The ECL rate of trade receivables as at 31 December
2023 and 2022 is less than 1%. Reversal of impairment losses for trade receivables of
US$4,000 (2022: US$2,000) was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Movement in the loss allowance account in respect of trade receivables during the year is as

(iii)

Credit risk of other financial assets at amortised cost
The Group’s other financial assets at amortised cost are considered to have low credit risk,
and the loss allowance recognised during the period was therefore limited to 12-month
expected losses. These financial instruments are considered to be low credit risk when they
have a low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash
flow obligations in the near term.

(d)

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its current and expected liquidity requirements, its
compliance with lending covenants and its relationship with its bankers to ensure that it maintains
sufficient reserves of cash to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term.

therefore are subject to fair value interest rate risks.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following disclosures of fair value
measurements use a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value:
Level 1 inputs:

quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs:

inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs:

unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of any of the three levels as of the date of
the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

maker (“CODM”), for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance focuses
on types of goods delivered, or service provided. The CEO has chosen to organise the Group’s results
according to the category of the business segment and differences in nature of the goods and services that
each segment delivers.
The Group has two operating segments as follows:
Fashion & lifestyle and
beauty products

–

Trading of fashion wears, lifestyle products and beauty products to
consumer

Entertainment products

–

Trading of entertainment products to consumer

The Group’s other operating segments represent revenue from logistic and ancillary services. None of these
segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments. The information of
these other operating segments is included in the “unallocated” column.
No analysis of segment assets or segment liabilities is presented as such information is not regularly
provided to the CODM.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies
described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment results do not include unallocated
administrative expenses, other income, other gains and losses and finance costs that are not directly
attributable to segments and income tax expense.

12. INCOME TAX EXPENSE/(CREDIT) (CONTINUED)
No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax has been made in the Company’s financial statements since the
Company has sufficient tax losses brought forward to set off against current year’s assessable profit.
No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax was required for the year ended 31 December 2022 since the
Company had no assessable profit for that year.
Under the two-tiered Profits Tax regime, the first HK$2 million of profits of the qualifying group entity
established in Hong Kong will be taxed at 8.25%, and profits above that amount will be subject to the tax
rate of 16.5%. The profits of the Group entities not qualifying for the two-tiered Profits Tax rate regime will
continue to be taxed at a rate of 16.5%.
YesAsia.com (Korea) Limited (“YAKR”) is subject to Korean Corporate Income Tax which comprised national
and local taxes (collectively “Korean Corporate Income Tax”). Korean Corporate Income Tax is generally
charged at the progressive rate from 9.9% to 26.4% (2022: 11.0% to 27.5%) on the estimated assessable
profit for the year. The progressive tax rates applicable to YAKR were 9.9% to 20.9% (2022: 11.0% to
22.0%) based on the estimated assessable profits for the year.
The Group’s branch in the United Kingdom (“UK branch”) is subject to the General Corporate Tax Rate
of the United Kingdom (collectively “UK Corporate Income Tax”). UK Corporate Income Tax is generally
charged at a small profits rate of 19%. No provision for UK Corporate Income Tax was required for the year
ended 31 December 2022 since the UK branch had no assessable profit for that year.
Tax charges on profits assessable elsewhere have been calculated at the rates of tax prevailing in the
countries in which the Group operates, based on existing legislation, interpretation and practices in respect
thereof.
The reconciliation between the income tax expense/(credit) and the product of profit/(loss) before tax

Defined contribution retirement plans
The Group contributes to defined contribution retirement plans which are available for all eligible

The Group mainly operates a Mandatory Provident Fund scheme (the “MPF Scheme”) under
the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance (Chapter 485 of the laws of Hong Kong) for
employees employed under the jurisdiction of Hong Kong Employment Ordinance (Chapter 57 of
the laws of Hong Kong). The MPF Scheme is a defined contribution retirement plan administered by
independent trustees. Under the MPF Scheme, the employer and the employees are each required
to make contributions to the plan at 5% of the employees’ relevant income, subject to a cap of
monthly relevant income of HK$30,000.
During the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no forfeited contributions
which may be used by the Group to reduce the existing level of contributions. There were also no
forfeited contributions available at 31 December 2023 and 2022 which may be used by the Group to
reduce the contribution payable in future years.

31 December 2022 (2022: US$0.0064 (equivalent to HK$0.05)
in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2021)
per ordinary share

A final dividend of HK5.0 cents per share for the year ended 31 December 2023 was recommended by
the Board at a Board meeting held on 28 March 2024. Such recommended final dividend is subject to the
approval of the members of the Company at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This recommended
final dividend is not reflected as a dividend payable in the financial statements, but will be reflected as
an appropriation of retained earnings for the year ending 31 December 2024 after the approval at the
forthcoming annual general meeting.

17. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share is based on the following:

The computation of diluted earnings/(loss) per share did not assume the exercise of the Company’s

price for shares for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022. Diluted earnings (2022: loss) per share
was the same as the basic earnings (2022: loss) per share for the year ended 31 December 2023.

Note:
(a)

(i)

The Group leased two properties for 6 years and 5 years (including 3 years extension option
exercised) as offices since 2020 and 2021 respectively. The leased properties were recognised
as right-of-use assets during the year ended 31 December 2021. The leases were modified
through shortening the contractual lease terms and changing the considerations in July 2022 and
December 2022 respectively. As the result, the corresponding right-of-use assets were adjusted
by deducting US$2,845,000, resulting in a gain on remeasurement of leases of US$107,000.

(ii)

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group terminated the lease of certain properties.
Therefore, the Group derecognised the related right-of-use assets of US$1,678,000, resulting in a
gain on derecognition of lease of US$101,000 being recognised in profit or loss for the year.

Note: (Continued)
(b)

Lease liabilities of US$12,184,000 (2022: US$15,464,000) are recognised with related right-of-use assets
of US$10,268,000 (2022: US$14,048,000) as at 31 December 2023. The lease agreements do not
impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.

(d)

The Group leases various leased properties and office equipment for its operations. Lease contracts
are entered into for fixed terms of 2 years to 4 years, but may have extension and termination options
as described below. Certain leases of office equipment were accounted for as finance leases during the
reporting period and carried interest ranging from 1.96% to 2.64% (2022: from 1.96% to 2.64%). Lease
terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In
determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period, the Group applies the
definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

(e)

Some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period after the end of the contract
term. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include such extension options exercisable by the Group to
provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably
certain to exercise the extension options. If the Group is not reasonably certain to exercise the extension
options, the future lease payments during the extension periods are not included in the measurement of
lease liabilities. The potential exposure to these future lease payments is summarised below:

In addition, the Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, upon
the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the
control of the lessee. During the year ended 31 December 2023, there has been no such triggering event.

(i)

In August 2019, the Company’s subsidiary, YesStyle.com Limited, entered into a life insurance policy
with an insurance company to insure Mr. Lau Kwok Chu, a director of the Company. Under the policy,
the beneficiary and the policy holder is YesStyle.com Limited and the total insured sum is US$2,462,000.
The Group was required to pay a one-off premium payment of US$860,000 at the inception of the policy.
A guaranteed interest rate of 3.9% per annum applied for the first 5 years, followed by the discretionary
portion with a minimum guaranteed interest rate of 2.25% per annum for the following years until
termination. The Group can terminate the policy at any time and receive cash back based on the cash
value of the policy at the date of withdrawal (“Cash Surrender Value”), which is determined by the premium
payment plus accumulated guaranteed interest earned minus the accumulated insurance charges, policy
expense charges and a specified amount of surrender charge if the withdrawal is made between 1st to
16th policy year.
The carrying amount represented the Cash Surrender Value of the policy and approximates its fair value at
the end of the reporting period. Details of fair value measurement are set out in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Note:
(i)

When the Group receives the payment in full before the goods is shipped/delivered, this will give rise
to contract liabilities at the start of a contract, until the revenue recognised when the goods is shipped/
delivered to the customers.

(ii)

Contract liabilities relating to deferred revenue for loyalty programme are a portion of the transaction price
allocated to the memberships based on the relative stand-alone selling price.

(iii)

Store credit is a type of refund offered by the Group to a customer who returns an item that allows them
to purchase something in the Group up to the value of a returned item. Store credit would be valid for 2
years upon the grant date. As at 31 December 2023, store credits granted to customers of US$2,522,000
were unused and expired in accordance with the terms of use of the Group. Such expired and unused
store credits were written back. Accordingly, the Group recognised revenue of US$2,522,000 for the year
ended 31 December 2023 (2022: HK$Nil) arising from the written back of the expired and unused store
credits.

The significant changes in the contract liabilities balances during the year ended 31 December 2023 were
mainly due to the Group’s customer base being broadened as compared to the year ended 31 December
2022, resulting in an increase in contract liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2023.
Except the store credits which would be valid for 2 years upon the grant date, all of the remaining contract
liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue within one year.

During the year ended 31 December 2023, 1,162,000 (2022: 56,000) ordinary shares of the Company
were issued under share option scheme. The net proceeds of US$92,000 (2022: US$7,000) were credited
to share capital with the average market price of approximately US$0.09 (2022: US$0.16) per share at the
respective exercise days.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern and to maximise the return to the members through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and
makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the
underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares,
buy-back shares, raise new debts, redeemed existing debts or sell assets to reduce debts.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is the Group’s total debts (comprising lease
liabilities) over its total equity. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio at a reasonable level. The
Group’s gearing ratios as at 31 December 2023 was 34.8% (2022: 57.0%). The decrease in the gearing
ratio of the Group is primarily due to the decrease in lease liabilities and the increase in equity as a result of
the profit generated for the year ended 31 December 2023.
The externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are: (i) in order to maintain its listing on the Stock
Exchange it has to have a public float of at least 25% of the shares; and (ii) to meet financial covenants
attached to the banking facilities granted.
Based on information that is publicly available to the Company and within the knowledge of the directors of
the Company, as at the date of this annual report, the Company has maintained sufficient public float with
at least 25% of the shares held by the public as required under the Listing Rules.
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any of these banking facilities for the years
ended 31 December 2023 and 2022.

36. OBLIGATION TO PAY LONG SERVICE PAYMENT UNDER HONG KONG
EMPLOYMENT ORDINANCE (CHAPTER 57)
Hong Kong employees that have been employed continuously for at least five years are entitled to
long service payment (“LSP”) in accordance with the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance under certain
circumstances. These circumstances include where an employee is dismissed for reasons other than
serious misconduct or redundancy, that employee resigns at the age of 65 or above, or the employment
contract is of fixed term and expires without renewal. The amount of LSP payable is determined with
reference to the employee’s final salary (capped at HK$22,500) and the years of service, reduced by the
amount of any accrued benefits derived from the Group’s contributions to MPF scheme (see Note 14), with
an overall cap of HK$390,000 per employee. Currently, the Group does not have any separate funding
arrangement in place to meet its LSP obligation.
In June 2022, the HKSAR gazetted the Amendment Ordinance, which abolishes the use of the accrued
benefits derived from employers’ mandatory MPF contributions to offset the LSP. The abolition will officially
take effect on 1 May 2025 (the “Transition Date”). Separately, the HKSAR is also expected to introduce a
subsidy scheme to assist employers for a period of 25 years after the Transition Date on the LSP payable
by employers up to a certain amount per employee per year.
Under the Amendment Ordinance, the Group’s mandatory MPF contributions, plus/minus any positive/
negative returns, after the Transition Date can continue to be applied to offset the pre-Transition Date
LSP obligation but are not eligible to offset the post-Transition Date long service payment obligation.
Furthermore, the LSP obligation before the Transition Date will be grandfathered and calculated based on
the last monthly wages immediately preceding the Transition Date and the years of service up to that date.
The Group has determined that the Amendment Ordinance primarily impacts the Group’s LSP liability with
respect to Hong Kong employees that participate in MPF Scheme and has confirmed that the abolition has
no material impact to the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023.
