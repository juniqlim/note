under CJ Olive Young Corporation, plus Belief and CNP Laboratory under LG Household & Health Care. In
addition, the Group became the exclusive distributor of a well-known K-Beauty brand -- Too Cool for School, in
the US market, operating across both B2C and B2B channels. Positioned as an authorized distributor of 466 KBeauty brands for global B2B and B2C channels, the Group has strengthened its position as a premier destination
for capturing a burgeoning consumer base, as well as for overseas enterprises to seek high-quality Asian beauty
products to grow their business.
Unlock Global Growth through Innovative Digital Marketing Initiatives
During the Period, US remained the largest market of the Group, accounting for 35.4% of the Group’s total revenue
and a growth rate of 42.4% as compared to the Prior Period. Meanwhile, European Union recorded a high growth
rate of 114.1%, with revenue reaching US$49.8 million, contributing 30.5% of the Group’s total revenue, followed
by United Kingdom at 7.2% and Canada at 6.0%. The enlarging market share of the Group was partly attributable
to its innovative digital marketing strategy leveraging influencers for the B2C platform starting in 2022. With the
total number of unique influencers increasing, revenue generated from influencer referrals during the Period
amounted to US$33.9 million, up by 115.2%, contributing 27.2% of the B2C platform’s revenue.
Currently, the Group’s B2C platform tops in traffic among Asian beauty shopping platforms in major overseas
markets, such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.1 To cater to a wider
geographical distribution of customers, YesStyle is available in a variety of languages, including Chinese, English,
French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. In addition, the Arabic language website was launched in August
2024. Meanwhile, partnering with influencers, who share the same characteristics of the target K-Beauty product
customer group, across various platforms, such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, has not only elevated the
market dominance of the Group’s B2C platform, but also increased its global exposure cost-effectively.
Meet Surging Customer Demand with an Additional Logistic Hub
In addition to the current autonomous mobile robotics (AMR) warehouse and fulfillment center in Hong Kong, the
Group also established three overseas warehouses in the US, the UK and Germany for its B2B channel. To keep
pace with the booming K-Beauty market, the Group is expanding its fulfillment capacity with a second AMR
warehouse at the Mapletree Logistics Hub in Hong Kong, which will commence operations in Q1 2025. Drawing
on the proven experience of the current fulfillment center, the new highly-automated facility will enable the Group
to increase operational efficiency and fulfillment capacity with relatively less manpower, thereby satisfying rapidly
growing customer demand across its e-commerce platforms.
Mr. Joshua Lau, Founder, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, said: “YesAsia Holdings is deeply
honored to have the trust of many K-Beauty brand partners and is delighted that, during the Period, thanks largely
to those partnerships, we made historical high first-half year revenue and profits. The Group has entered the
expansion phase, not only capable of reaching to new promising markets via our B2C platforms and bolster the
strength of our digital marketing strategy through the influencer program, but is also opening the door through its
B2B platform for more overseas companies to harness the global surge in demand for K-Beauty products. Looking
ahead, we remain steadfast in our vision to be ‘the go-to e-commerce gateway for leading Asian brand partners
seeking to reach a global audience’, and will continue to strengthen our competitive brand portfolio, digital
marketing strategy and fulfillment capabilities, so as to return value to our stakeholders in the long run.”
