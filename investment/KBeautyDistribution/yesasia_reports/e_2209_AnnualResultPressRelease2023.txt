for the year ended 31 December 2023 (the “Year”).
In 2023, the Group recorded record-high revenue of US$201.3 million (2022: US$128.6 million),
representing a year-on-year (“YoY”) increase of 56.6%. Driven by expanded collaboration with Kbeauty brands, revenue from beauty products increased by 133.2% YoY to US$162.2 million (2022:
US$69.6 million). Gross profit increased by 46.7% YoY from US$42.7 million in 2022 to US$62.7
million in 2023. As a result of rapid revenue growth and stringent budget control, the Group achieved
a remarkable turnaround to a net profit of US$7.6 million (2022: US$6.8 million loss). To express its
gratitude for the unwavering support of its esteemed shareholders, the Group proposed a final
dividend of HK5.0 cents (2022: Nil), representing a payout ratio of 33.8%.

2023 Operational Highlights
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) platforms (YesStyle Platforms)
Revenue contributed by YesStyle Platforms was approximately (“approx.”) US$158.7 million (2022:
US$109.9 million), representing a YoY increase of approx. 44.3%, which was driven by a YoY
increase of approx. 52.3% in the number of sales orders received. The YesStyle sales order number
in the European Union, Canada, and the United Kingdom increased YoY by 136.8%, 117.5%, and
77.2%, respectively.
A new front page and a beauty products-focused promotion strategy were introduced on YesStyle
Platforms in January 2023. Since then, YesStyle has become one of the top Asian beauty shopping
platforms in North America and Europe. YesStyle Platforms successfully ranked as the 10th and 6th
most-visited beauty websites in the US by SimilarWeb and Semrush, respectively.
Business-to-Business (B2B) platform (AsianBeautyWholesale)
AsianBeautyWholesale (“ABW”) continued to grow quickly during the Year as K-Beauty’s popularity
grew worldwide. With YoY growth during the Year in the number of customers, number of orders, and
average order size of approx. 90.1%, 143.4% and 38.6%, respectively, revenue from ABW rose to
approx. US$38.8 million (2022: US$11.6 million), representing a YoY increase of approx. 234.4%.
Products
In 2023, the Group continued to strengthen its competitive edge in the K-Beauty product market. The
Group partnered with 78 new K-Beauty brands with business potential to enrich its brand variety,
while removing 60 underperforming brands. As at 31 December 2023, YesStyle is partners with 448
K-Beauty brands (2022: 430).
The Group strived to foster closer relationships with K-Beauty partners. LG H&H Co., Ltd., a major
South Korean consumer goods company under LG Corporation, granted the Group authorisation to
distribute additional 14 LG brands during the Year. In addition, the Group further strengthened its
partnerships with two popular K-Beauty companies, Amorepacific Corporation and CJ Olive Young
Corporation by adding one more brand from Amorepacific Corporation, espoir, and 5 more brands
under CJ Olive Young Corporation, namely IDEAL FOR MEN, fillimilli, colorgram, ROUND A’ROUND,
and BIOHEAL BOH to its e-commerce platforms.
YesStyle Influencer Program
The YesStyle Influencer Program showed strong growth during the Year. In 2023, revenue generated
from influencers’ referrals amounted to approx. US$40.4 million (2022: US$21.9 million), representing
an increase of 84.6% as compared to the Prior Year, demonstrating the continuous success of the
YesStyle Influencer Program. Such contribution represented approx. 25.5% of revenue generated
from YesStyle (2022: 19.9%).
The number of influencers grew from approx. 279,000 at the end of 2022 to approx. 333,000 as at 31
December 2023, representing an increase of approx. 54,000 influencers. The Group continued to
partner with influencers to create interesting videos and posts on various platforms, including
Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, etc., which increased YesStyle’s exposure and referral revenue. In
particular, the total number of YesStyle TikTok Influencers continued to grow rapidly, from approx.
44,000 at the end of 2022 to approx. 72,000 at the end of 2023.

Customer Relationship Management System
The CRM System continued to strengthen the Group’s targeted marketing and promotions during adhoc campaigns and the peak season. In 2023, the Group enhanced its “welcome journey” by
analysing customers’ entry points and product preferences. Revenue facilitated by the CRM System
amounted to approx. US$26.0 million (2022: US$14.9 million), representing a growth of 74.7% YoY.
The number of YesStyle loyalty program members increased to approx. 11,617,000 as at 31
December 2023 (2022: 8,272,000), representing an approx. 40.4% YoY increase.
Cost Saving Measures
As a result of stringent control on expenditures, the increase in total selling expenses and
administrative expenses was much less than the high revenue growth in 2023. Selling expenses,
excluding payment gateway charges, amounted to approx. US$18.7 million for the Year (2022:
US$15.7 million), representing a YoY increase of 19.3%. Payment gateway charges for the Year
increased YoY by approx. 54.6%, which was in line with revenue growth.
In addition, administrative expenses decreased to approx. US$29.6 million during the Year (2022:
US$30.7 million), representing a YoY decrease of approx. 3.6%. This was the result of the decrease
in depreciation of right-of-use assets, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, rates and
management fees under administrative expenses due to the establishment of our Smart Robotics
Warehouse.
With the continuous fine-tuning of the Autonomous Mobile Robots (“AMR”) system, the efficiency of
the Group’s fulfillment was enhanced to cope with sales order growth, bringing further cost-saving
benefits to operations. In 2023, the percentage of outsourced warehouse labour charges and
warehouse wages in aggregate to revenue was approx. 3.5% (2022: 5.2%). The AMR system
successfully achieved an annual savings of approx. US$3.4 million or 32.5% if no AMRs were used.
Outlook
Mr. Lau Kwok Chu, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of YesAsia, commented, “We are
pleased to share with you the fruitful results of 2023. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our
team members, we have achieved substantial business growth and delivered a remarkable financial
performance. As one of the pioneering enterprises entering the e-commerce sector decades ago, we
truly understand that the courage to change is the key to sustainable development. In recent years,
we have observed the rising popularity of Korean beauty and cosmetics products in European and US
markets. As a result, we have actively enhanced our cooperation with K-Beauty brands, successfully
capitalizing on such opportunities and achieving remarkable business growth.”
“Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen our position in the Korean beauty products market in
Europe and the United States. We will strive to cooperate with more emerging brands from South
Korea and will introduce a greater variety of high-quality products to our e-commerce platforms.
Meanwhile, we will actively work on improving our operational performance to increase profits. In
addition to the AMR warehouse, we are also planning to launch multiple warehousing facilities in
overseas markets to enhance efficiency and achieve greater business synergies.”
