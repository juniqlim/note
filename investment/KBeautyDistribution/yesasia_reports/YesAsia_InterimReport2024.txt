MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The Group has reached a historical high for its first-half revenue. Thanks to the rise in sales in beauty products via
both its retail platforms and wholesale platforms – YesStyle and AsianBeautyWholesale, particularly in the US and
Europe.
During the Reporting Period:
–

Revenue increased by about 80.2% to approximately US$163,348,000 (Prior Period: US$90,657,000)

–

Net profit rocketed over six times to approximately US$11,107,000, as compared with approximately
US$1,563,000 in the Prior Period

Beauty products – a major growth driver
–

The stellar performance of beauty products, in particular Korean beauty (“K-Beauty”) products, made it a
major revenue growth driver during the Reporting Period

–

Beauty products contributed approximately 91.4% of the Group’s revenue during the Reporting Period, as
compared with approximately 80.6% during the year ended 31 December 2023

–

Pursuing both diversity and quality, the Group has re-shuffled its brand portfolio to partner with 466 K-Beauty
brands (31 December 2023: 448) after ceasing partnership with 15 underperforming brands

–

During the Reporting Period, the Group has also strengthened its on-going partnership with popular K-Beauty
companies including Amorepacific Corporations, CJ Olive Young and LG Household & Health Care (“LG
H&H”) by adding several more of their brands to our platforms, namely Mamonde and B.READY from
Amorepacific Corporation, CARE PLUS under CJ Olive Young Corporation, and Belief and CNP Laboratory,
from LG H&H

–

Revenue contributed by entertainment products and fashion products continued to downtrend as the
Group focused on its beauty products

Europe outpaced US in revenue growth

8

–

European Union (“EU”) overtook US in revenue growth, recording a three-digit growth rate of approximately
114.1% during the Reporting Period. It contributed approximately 30.5% of the Group’s revenue during the
Reporting Period

–

United States, representing approximately 35.4% of the Group’s business, still recorded a double-digit
growth rate (approximately 42.4% during the Reporting Period)

–

Latin America and Middle East regions, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”),
also demonstrated strong growth momentum

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Big leap in retail e-commerce mirrored in wholesale
–

Revenue from YesStyle platforms, which cater to B2C customers, jumped approximately 75.1% to about
US$125,132,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$71,450,000), driven by record-high sales in
beauty products

–

YesStyle Platforms were also ranked as No.1 most visit website for Asian beauty products in many major
overseas markets, including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Spain

–

Revenue from AsianBeautyWholesale, on the other hand, was more than doubled to approximately
US$36,951,000 (Prior Period: US$17,423,000), contributing approximately 22.6% of the Group’s total
revenue

–

AsianBeautyWholesale’s number of customers, number of orders and average order size rose by
approximately 8.4%, 50.1% and 41.3% respectively as compared to the Prior Period

Social media and digital technologies in e-commerce
The effective application of digital technologies is indispensable in e-commerce where potential customers are
usually perusing several shopping sites at the same time while relying heavily on online reviews for their purchase
decisions. YesAsia was one of the first in the market to heavily invest in social media marketing, and AI-powered
customer relationship management system.
i)

Social media: YesStyle Influencer Program
–

The new incentives, new loyalty program and continued recruitment driving under the YesStyle
Influencer Program have translated into growth, reaching over 1 million users across various social
media platforms

–

The total number of unique influencers grew to approximately 365,000 by the end of June 2024 (31
December 2023: 333,000)

–

In particular, the number of YesStyle TikTok Influencers reached approximately 87,000 at the end of
June 2024 (31 December 2023: 72,000), representing a growth rate of approximately 20.8%

–

During the Reporting Period, revenue generated from influencer referrals was more than double to
approximately US$33,934,000 (Prior Period: US$15,769,000), amounting to approximately 27.2% of
the YesStyle Platforms’ revenue (Prior Period: 22.1%)

–

We continued to partner with influencers to create interesting videos and posts on various platforms,
including Instagram, TikTok and YouTube

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ii)

Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) System
Powered by AI technology, our CRM system has effectively enhanced customer retention rate, and
increased revenue from existing customers:
–

Revenue facilitated by the CRM System had more than doubled to approximately US$23,796,000
during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$11,524,000)

–

The number of YesStyle loyalty program members grew by approximately 18.4% to approximately
13,753,000 as at 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: 11,617,000)

–

YesStyle Student Program, targeting Generation Z students, reached approximately 149,000
members at the end of the Reporting Period (Prior Period: 70,000); revenue generated went up by
approximately 44.9% to approximately US$3,402,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period:
US$2,348,000)

Cost control
We have been keeping a close eye on cost-control as agility is vital in the fast-paced business environment of
e-commerce. Under stringent costs control measures, we have been able to keep our expenses growth rate below
our revenue growth rate:
–

Our selling expenses, excluding payment gateway charges, amounted to approximately US$14,562,000 for
the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$8,844,000), representing an increase of approximately 64.7%, which
is lower than the growth rate of the Group’s revenue (approximately 80.2%) during the same period

–

Administrative staff costs, on the other hand, increased by approximately 30.6% to approximately
US$10,584,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$8,107,000) mainly due to approximately
US$1,820,000 of bonuses accrued (Prior Period: Nil) as the Group achieved the set performance during the
Reporting Period.

In addition, we continue to manage our inventories in good quality and optimal quantity. Inventories written down
amounted to approximately US$98,000 for the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$187,000), representing 0.1%
(Prior Period: 0.2%) of the Group’s revenue. Return rate for YesStyle had also been maintained at 0.4% (Prior
Period: 0.8%) while revenue grew during the Reporting Period.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PROSPECTS
We feel encouraged by our strong performance in 2024 1H, and would like to express our appreciation to our
colleagues, partners, and customers.
Looking forward, we are excited by what lies ahead for YesStyle. Despite macroeconomics headwinds such as
geopolitics, trade relations, and inflation, we are optimistic about the prospects of YesStyle as its diverse portfolio
of K-Beauty products continues to appeal to its global audience – particularly in Europe and the US, where K-Beauty
products have surpassed French beauty products for the first time to top the import cosmetics market share.
K-Beauty: strong, sustainable growth in the US and Europe
Korean cosmetics products reached a remarkable milestone in the US market, overtaking French beauty products
in the US import cosmetics market share during the first four months of 2024. According to data from the United
States International Trade Commission (“USITC”), Korea came out at the top of the US import cosmetics market
share for the first time, capturing 20.1% of the market with a value of US$477.1 million. It has displaced France, a
traditional global leader in cosmetics, which came in second with US$459.43 million, accounting for 19.3% of the
market share. The popularity of K-Beauty is expected to continue in the US market – the North America K-Beauty
products market is expected to grow with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10.02% during the period
from 2023 to 2032, where it is expected to reach US$9.9 billion in revenue.
Similarly, Europe K-beauty products market size is set to increase at a CAGR of 9.48% during the same period,
where its revenue is expected to grow to US$5.6 billion by 2032. That is why we have been active in recruiting
influencers across the world to run the social media marketing campaigns in their respective markets, and
investing in multiple European language versions of our website. We are operating Spanish and Arabic languages
on YesStyle to unleash the market potential of Latin America and Middle East.
Competitive pricing, delivery and user experience
E-commerce boom is expected to carry on as statistics have shown that online shopping is here to stay, for
example, 22.6% of total retail sales will be conducted online by 2027. Optimisation has therefore become a
business mandate to remain competitive in an ever-changing, price-sensitive industry overshadowed by high
inflation, currency fluctuation and supply chain challenges.
To further control costs, shorten delivery time and enhance online order fulfilment, we are planning to build a
second AMR warehouse in Hong Kong, and have established overseas warehouses in the US, the U.K., and
Germany to cater for our B2C and B2B customers around the world. We are also exploring partnership with
logistics companies to further reduce freight costs from Hong Kong and South Korea to overseas markets.
On the other hand, our CRM system utilises AI algorithms in collecting and analysing real-time transactional and
behavioural customer data. The system then enhances sales performance by providing the best selections to
customers that cater to their preferences in terms of product types, and pricing.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Scalability: additional logistics hub to meet surging customer demand
The additional warehouses in Hong Kong, the US, the UK and Germany not only help shorten delivery time
and lower transportation costs, but also increase the scalability of YesStyle as it responds to the rapid surge in
customer demand.
The second AMR warehouse at the Mapletree Logistic Hub in Hong Kong will play a vital role in responding to
the ebbs and flows in market demand. Drawing on the proven experience of the current fulfilment centre, the new
highly-automated facility will enable the Group to increase operational efficiency and capacity with relatively less
manpower, thereby satisfying rapidly growing customer demand across its e-commerce platforms. The second
AMR warehouse is expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2025.
Deep collaboration with brands: social media marketing and brand management
Social media shopping has been on the rise among younger consumers – for example, the Group has found that
more and more users are making purchases directly on TikTok. As such, YesAsia is taking a step forward in its
digital marketing solutions: we not only promote our partnering brands on our own website, but also mobilize our
approximately 365,000 influencers online to help them run their social media platforms, and online shops.
For example, in 2024 June, we have kicked off a three-year US exclusive distribution agreement with Too Cool for
School (“TCFS”), which puts us in charge of running its US Amazon store and US official website for both B2C
and B2B channels. We have also been recruiting online influencers for the brand, setting up and operating its US
Instagram and TikTok accounts, as well as building up its offline channels. Our marketing strategies will be backed
up by the transactional and behavioural data collected from millions of customers via our CRM system.
Meet surging customer demand with an additional logistic hub
To keep pace with the booming K-Beauty market, the Group has established three overseas warehouses in the
US, the UK and Germany and is building a second AMR warehouse at the Mapletree Logistics Hub in Hong Kong.
Looking forward, we are optimistic about YesAsia’s performance for the rest of the 2024, and beyond. We will
continue to be agile in adapting to the changing environments, and work with the best brands, and best people to
bring the best of Asia to the rest of the world.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales of the Group during the Reporting Period was approximately US$113,156,000, representing an
increase of approximately US$50,681,000 or 81.1%, as compared to approximately US$62,475,000 during the
Prior Period. However, product costs as percentage of revenue increased by approximately 1.0 percentage points
to approximately 47.3% during the Reporting Period from approximately 46.3% in the Prior Period. This was mainly
because of the increase in the weighting of revenue from AsianBeautyWholesale which has a lower markup as it is
a wholesale business.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Finance Costs
The Group’s finance costs for the Reporting Period were approximately US$504,000 (Prior Period: US$642,000),
representing a decrease of approximately 21.5% as compared to the Prior Period, reflecting a decrease in interest
on lease liabilities and provision for reinstatement costs during the Reporting Period.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense for the Reporting Period was approximately US$2,416,000 (Prior Period: US$319,000),
representing an increase of approximately US$2,097,000 or 657.4% as compared to the Prior Period. The
increase was mainly due to the higher taxable profit generated during the Reporting Period.
Profit for the Period
As a result of the foregoing, a profit of approximately US$11,107,000 was recorded for the Reporting Period (Prior
Period: US$1,563,000). The increase in profit was mainly attributable to (i) an enhancement of YesStyle Platforms’
marketing efforts to promote the sale of beauty products, and (ii) the expansion of AsianBeautyWholesale to serve
more business-to-business (B2B) customers who are looking to source Asian beauty products globally.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
During the Reporting Period, the Group acquired plant and equipment of approximately US$168,000 (Prior Period:
US$252,000), representing a decrease of approximately US$84,000 or 33.3% as compared to that for the Prior
Period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal source of liquidity was cash from operations and the proceeds from Listing. As of 30 June
2024, the Group’s bank and cash balances amounted to approximately US$6,868,000 (31 December 2023:
US$25,181,000).
Our bank and cash balances, which were mainly denominated in US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won,
British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Euro and Renminbi, decreased by approximately US$18,081,000
during the Reporting Period which was attributable to (i) net cash used in operating activities of approximately
US$15,148,000; (ii) principal elements of lease payments of approximately US$2,863,000; (iii) increase in pledged
bank fixed deposits approximately US$417,000; (iv) purchase of property, plant and equipment of approximately
US$168,000; and (v) purchase of intangible asset of approximately US$50,000; partially offset by (i) US$430,000
of proceeds from issuance of shares; and (ii) US$151,000 of interest received.
The net cash used in operating activities was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of
approximately US$18,201,000 during the Reporting Period and an increase in trade and other payables and
accruals by approximately US$3,253,000, offset by (i) an increase in inventories by approximately US$28,839,000;
(ii) an increase in prepayments, deposits and other receivables by approximately US$4,330,000; (iii) a decrease
in contract liabilities by approximately US$1,941,000; and (iv) an increase in trade receivables by approximately
US$638,000.
As at 30 June 2024, the Group had no bank borrowing (31 December 2023: Nil). The unutilised banking facilities as
at 30 June 2024 amounted to approximately US$4,355,000 (31 December 2023: US$5,015,000).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

We believe that our liquidity requirements and our expected source of funding going forward will be satisfied by using
a combination of cash generated from our operations and net proceeds from Listing.

TREASURY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES
The Group’s treasury management policy is to avoid any investment in highly-leveraged or speculative derivative
products. The Group continued to be conservative in managing financial risk during the Reporting Period.
Consistent with the aforesaid treasury objectives and policy, the Group undertakes treasury management activities
with respect to its surplus cash assets. The selection criteria of investments include the relative risk profile
involved, the liquidity of an investment, the after-tax equivalent yield of an investment and investments that are not
speculative in nature.
Most business transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group were denominated either in US Dollar, Hong Kong
Dollar, Korean Won, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Euro or Renminbi. The E-commerce customers of
the Group generally settle their invoices using their designated currencies upon checkout via secure payment
gateways, and the fund is generally transferred to the Group’s account in Hong Kong Dollar and US Dollar upon
currency conversion. As Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to US Dollar, our Group does not expect any significant
movements in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars. Besides, our Group has certain
exposure to foreign currency risk as some of our business transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated
in currencies (i.e. Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Euro, etc) other than the
functional currency of our Group (i.e. US Dollar).
Currently, we do not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy. However, our management monitors the
Group’s foreign exchange exposure constantly and will consider engaging in derivatives markets or foreign
exchange hedging measures to minimise the foreign exchange risk when it is foreseen to be significant.

GEARING RATIO
Our gearing ratio, calculated by the total interest-bearing liabilities (including lease liabilities) divided by total equity,
decreased from approximately 34.8% as at 31 December 2023 to approximately 23.9% as at 30 June 2024,
primarily due to amortisation of lease liabilities during the Reporting Period.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
As at 30 June 2024, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities (31 December 2023: Nil).

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Saved for those disclosed in Note 20 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information, the Group did
not have any significant capital commitments as at 30 June 2024.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELD
During the Reporting Period, we did not hold any significant investments, save for the 1,100,000 shares in CN
Logistics, representing approximately 0.37% of the issued share capital of CN Logistics as at 30 June 2024, with
a fair value amounted to approximately US$553,000 as at 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: US$863,000). The
investment represents approximately 0.6% of the total consolidated asset of the Group as at 30 June 2024 (31
December 2023: 1.2%). The aforementioned 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics were subscribed by the Company
at a total cash consideration of HK$10,120,000. The principal activity of CN Logistics is investment holding, which
through its subsidiaries, is principally engaged in the provision of air freight forwarding services and distribution and
logistics services in relation to fashion products and fine wine, primarily focusing on high-end fashion (including
luxury and affordable luxury) products. CN Logistics is a strategic logistics partner of the Group for delivery of our
customers’ products to the US, Europe and other overseas markets.
As at 30 June 2024, the unrealised fair value loss of such investment was approximately US$310,000 due to the
decrease in share price of CN Logistics during the Reporting Period from our subscription price of HK$9.20 per
share. A dividend of approximately US$2,000 had been recognised from the investment during the Reporting
Period. In view of the expected positive impact to the businesses of both CN Logistics and the Group through
the strategic logistics partnership and the deepened collaboration during the Reporting Period, the investment in
CN Logistics is expected to be strategic and enable the Group to foster a closer business partnership with CN
Logistics for a longer term and result in potential investment returns to the Shareholders.

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The Board has resolved not to declare any interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (Prior Period:
Nil).

FUTURE PLANS FOR MATERIAL INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL ASSETS
Except as disclosed herein and apart from investment for operation purposes which may be made in the ordinary
and usual course of business, as of the date of this report, the Group did not have any concrete immediate
future plans for material investments or capital assets but the Group may explore potential opportunities to make
investment and/or acquire capital assets for sustainable growth.

MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND FUTURE PLANS FOR SUBSIDIARIES
During the Reporting Period and as of the date of this interim report, we did not have any material acquisition or
disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures nor any future plans in relation to such actions.

CHARGE ON ASSETS
As at 30 June 2024, the banking facilities of the Group mainly comprised corporate credit cards and letters of
guarantee issued to the Group and Group’s suppliers for products purchased by the Group and securing the
payments to the Group’s suppliers respectively. The banking facilities were secured by the pledged deposit of the
Group of approximately US$1,674,000 as of 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: US$1,257,000).

OTHER INFORMATION

Post-IPO Share Option Scheme
A post-IPO share option scheme was adopted by the Company on 13 March 2021, which was conditional upon
the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange and came into effect on 9 July 2021 (the “Post-IPO Share
Option Scheme”). The Post-IPO Share Option Scheme shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years
from the date of the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange until 8 July 2031. The purpose of the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company
to attract and retain qualified employees or directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries through providing
them with an opportunity for investment in the shares of the Company. Participants of the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme include any individual, being an employee or director of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries
who the Board or its delegate(s) considers, in their sole discretion, to have contributed or will contribute to
the business performance of the Group. However, no individual who is a resident in a place where the grant,
acceptance or exercise of options pursuant to the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is not permitted under the laws
and regulations of such place or where, in the view of the Board or its delegate(s), compliance with applicable laws
and regulations in such place makes it necessary or expedient to exclude such individual from the grant or offer of
such options.
The total number of Shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options to be granted under the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is 39,539,079, being 10% of the Shares in issue on the date the Shares commence trading
on the Stock Exchange (the “Option Scheme Mandate Limit”) (excluding any Shares which may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Pre-IPO Share Option Schemes). Options
which have lapsed in accordance with the terms of the rules of the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme (or any other
share option schemes of the Company) shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating the Option Scheme
Mandate Limit.
Unless approved by the Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of
the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme and any other share option
scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised and outstanding options) in
any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any
further grant of options to a selected participant which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued
and to be issued upon exercise of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including
exercised, canceled and outstanding options) in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such further
grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of the Shareholders (with such selected
participant and his associates abstaining from voting). There was no option granted under such circumstances
during the Reporting Period.

OTHER INFORMATION

Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme.
The subscription price, being the amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option, in the
event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the greater of:
(i)

the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock Exchange on the
date of grant;

(ii)

the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and

(iii)

the nominal value of the Shares on the date of grant.

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no grantee shall in any way
sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or create any interest in favor of or enter into
any agreement with any other person over or in relation to any option.
Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the Company (or any of
their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent non-executive Directors (excluding any
independent non-executive Director who is a proposed recipient of the grant of options).
In addition, where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive Director
of the Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of Shares issued and to be
issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted (including options exercised, canceled and
outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such grant:
(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii)

having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets
issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess of HK$5,000,000 (or such other higher
amount as may from time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way of poll) in a general
meeting. In obtaining the approval, the Company shall send a circular to the Shareholders in accordance with and
containing such information as is required under the Listing Rules. All core connected persons of the Company
shall abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any core connected person may vote against the
relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been stated in the circular to be
sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith. There was no option granted under such circumstances during
the Reporting Period.

OTHER INFORMATION

MATERIAL LITIGATION
During the Reporting Period, the Group was not involved in any material litigation or arbitration, nor were the
Directors aware of any material litigation or claims that were pending or threatened against the Group.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board has established the Audit Committee, comprising one non-executive Director, namely Mr. Hui Yat
Yan Henry and three independent non-executive Directors, namely Mr. Wong Chee Chung (Chairman), Mr. Sin
Pak Cheong Philip Charles and Mr. Chan Yu Cheong. The primary duties of the Audit Committee are to review
and supervise our financial reporting process and the internal control system of the Group, manage risk, perform
internal audit, provide advice and comments to the Board and perform other duties and responsibilities as may be
assigned by the Board.
The interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2024 have not been
audited by the auditors of the Company but have been reviewed by the Audit Committee.

PURCHASE, SALE OR REDEMPTION OF LISTED SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY
During the Reporting Period, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has purchased, sold or redeemed
any of the Company’s listed securities, save for the grant of 309,000 options (each option shall entitle the holder to
subscribe for 10 Shares) under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme on 26 April 2024.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our Company has complied with code provisions stated in the Corporate Governance Code in Appendix C1 to
the Listing Rules (the “Corporate Governance Code”) during the Reporting Period. As of 30 June 2024 and
to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of our Directors, having made all reasonable enquiries, our
Directors are not aware of any deviation from the code provisions of the Corporate Governance Code during the
Reporting Period, apart from the deviation from Code Provision D.2.5 of the Corporate Governance Code during
the Reporting Period. Under Code Provision D.2.5, issuers should have an internal audit function.
The Group does not have an internal audit function and the Board is of the view that there is no immediate need to
set up an internal audit function within the Group having reviewed the size, nature and complexity of the Group’s
business during the Reporting Period. It was decided that the Board would be directly responsible for internal
control of the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Procedures have been designed for safeguarding assets
against unauthorised use or disposition, ensuring the maintenance of proper accounting records for the provision
of reliable financial information for internal use or for publication, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws,
rules and regulations. The situation will be reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.
Save as disclosed above, none of the Directors is aware of any information which would reasonably indicate that
the Company had not, throughout the Reporting Period, fully complied with the Code Provisions.
Our Directors will review our corporate governance policies and compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
each financial year and comply with the “comply or explain” principle in our corporate governance report, which will
be included in our annual reports.

CORPORATE AND GROUP INFORMATION
The Company was incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability. The registered office and principal place
of business in Hong Kong is 5/F, KC100, 100 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung, New Territories, Hong
Kong.
The Group is principally engaged in trading of fashion wear, cosmetics and accessories and entertainment
products through the Group’s own e-commerce platforms (including websites and mobile app).
The Company has no ultimate holding company, and ultimate controlling shareholders of the Company are
Mr. Lau Kwok Chu and Ms. Chu Lai King respectively.
This condensed consolidated interim financial information is presented in United State dollars (“US$”),
unless otherwise stated.
The financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2023 that is included in the condensed
consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2024 as comparative
information does not constitute the Company’s statutory annual consolidated financial statements for that
year but is derived from those financial statements. Further information relating to these statutory financial
statements required to be disclosed in accordance with section 436 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.
622 of the Laws of Hong Kong) is as follows:
The Company has delivered the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 to the Registrar
of Companies as required by section 662(3) of, and Part 3 of Schedule 6 to, the Companies Ordinance (Cap.
622 of the Laws of Hong Kong).
The Company’s auditor has reported on those financial statements. The auditor’s report was unqualified;

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CHANGES TO THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The unaudited interim condensed financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2024 has been
prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Accounting Standard 34 (“HKAS 34”) Interim Financial Reporting
issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”), as well as with the
applicable disclosures required by the Listing Rules.
The interim condensed financial information does not include all of the information and disclosures required
in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with the Hong
Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”).
The preparation of interim condensed financial information requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim condensed financial information
are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2023.
In the current period, the Group has adopted all the new and revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting
Standards issued by the HKICPA that are relevant to its operations and effective for its accounting year
beginning on 1 January 2024 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning
after 1 January 2024 and earlier application is permitted. The Group has not adopted in advance any of
the forthcoming new or amended standards in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following disclosures of fair value
measurements use a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value:
Level 1 inputs:

quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs:

inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs:

unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of any of the three levels as of the date of
the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Disclosures of level in fair value hierarchy:

Recurring fair value measurements:

Notes:
(i)

When the Group receives the payment in full before the goods is shipped/delivered, this will give rise
to contract liabilities at the start of a contract, until the revenue recognised when the goods is shipped/
delivered to the customers.

(ii)

Contract liabilities relating to deferred revenue for loyalty programme are a portion of the transaction price
allocated to the memberships based on the relative stand-alone selling price.

(iii)

Store credit is a type of refund offered by the Group to a customer who returns an item that allows them
to purchase something in the Group up to the value of a returned item. Store credit would be valid for 2
years upon the grant date. As at 30 June 2024, store credits granted to customers of US$189,000 were
unused and expired in accordance with the terms of use of the Group. Such expired and unused store
credits were written back. Accordingly, the Group recognised revenue of US$189,000 for the six months
ended 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: US$2,522,000) arising from the written back of the expired and
unused store credits.

The significant changes in the contract liabilities balances during the six months ended 30 June 2024 were
mainly due to the Group’s fulfilment efficiency has been increased as compared to the year ended 31
December 2023, resulting in a decrease in contract liabilities for the period ended 30 June 2024.
Except the store credits which would be valid for 2 years upon the grant date, all of the remaining contract
liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue within one year.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (CONTINUED)
Risk-free rates adopted in the valuation model are the yield-to-maturities in continuous compounding of the
Hong Kong Government Bonds with the time-to-maturities similar to that of the options as at the date of
grant.
Where a share option is cancelled or forfeited prior to the expiry date, it is treated as if it had vested on
the date of cancellation or forfeiture, and any expense not yet recognised for the option is recognised
immediately.
The Group recorded total expenses of approximately US$106,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior
Period: US$240,000) in respect of the share option schemes.
Note: The calculation results of the values of the share options are subject to a number of assumptions of the
parameters used herein and the limitation of the model adopted. Therefore, the estimated values of the
share options may be subjective and uncertain.

During the six months ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 respectively, the accounting policy adopted
for the share options are as follow:
The Group issues share options to certain directors and employees.
Share options granted to directors and employees are measured at the fair value (excluding the effect
of non-market-based vesting conditions) of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the share options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions.
