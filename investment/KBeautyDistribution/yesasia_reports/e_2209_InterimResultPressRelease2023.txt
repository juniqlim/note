(25 August 2023 – Hong Kong) YesAsia Holdings Limited (“YesAsia”, and together with its
subsidiaries, the “Group”) (stock code: 2209) is pleased to announce its unaudited consolidated results
for the 6 months ended 30 June 2023 (the “Period”).
During the Period, the Group achieved substantial revenue growth with a significant increase of 44.1%
as compared to the 6 months ended 30 June 2022 (the “Prior Period”), translating to approximately
US$90.7 million in revenue, up from the previous figure of US$62.9 million during the Prior Period. This
remarkable turnaround was fuelled primarily by a robust 121.6% increase in sales of beauty products
on both the Group’s YesStyle and AsianBeautyWholesale platforms. This is a historical high in the
Group’s first-half revenue history, and reverses the losses incurred in 2021 and 2022 to achieve a net
profit of approximately US$1.6 million during the Period (Prior Period: US$2.3 million loss).

YesStyle
Revenue contributed to the Group by YesStyle platforms increased by 32.0% to US$71.5 million (Prior
Period: US$54.1 million), which was driven by increasing sales of beauty products, and represents
78.8% of total revenue. Starting January 2023, YesStyle platforms implemented a new “front page”
and “beauty-products-focused” promotional strategy to support the Group’s lucrative beauty segment,
and bolstered numerous marketing initiatives to further support beauty product sales. The Group also
strengthened its partnerships with two popular K-Beauty companies, Amorepacific Corporation and CJ
Olive Young Corporation, while adding to its e-commerce platforms one more brand from Amorepacific
Corporation, espoir, and 5 more brands under CJ Olive Young Corporation, namely IDEAL FOR MEN,
fillimilli, colorgram, ROUND A’ROUND and BIOHEAL BOH.
AsianBeautyWholesale (ABW)
ABW continued to grow rapidly during the Period. The number of customers grew by approximately
174.8% as compared to the Prior Period. The increase in number of orders, and average size of orders,
which grew by approximately 212.7% and 34.3% respectively as compared to the Prior Period, led to a
significant revenue rise for ABW, reaching approximately US$17.4 million during the Period and
marking an impressive 317.4% increase as compared to the Prior Period. Also greatly contributing to
the aforementioned robust growth is ABW’s expansion to serve more business-to-business (B2B)
customers looking to source Asian beauty products globally.
YesStyle Influencer Program
The YesStyle Influencer Program showed strong growth during the Period, with the total number of
unique influencers growing to approximately 311,000, representing an increase of approximately 11.4%
since December 2022. Revenue generated from influencer referrals amounted to approximately
US$15.8 million (Prior Period: US$9.3 million), representing a growth of approximately 69.9%.
Revenue generated from influencer referrals as a percentage of YesStyle platforms revenue increased
to approximately 22.1% during the Period (Prior Period: 17.3%).
YesAsia
For YesAsia, revenue for the Period decreased by approximately 69.6% as compared to that in the
Prior Period. The decrease was mainly due to a lack of popular new releases during the Period.
CRM system
To maximize outreach and deliver the highest value possible to its existing customers, YesAsia took a
strategic leap by implementing a robust CRM System. During the Period, revenue facilitated by the
CRM System amounted to approximately US$11.5 million (Prior Period: US$5.6 million). In addition,
the number of YesStyle loyalty program members increased to approximately 9,749,000 as at 30 June
2023 (31 December 2022: 8,272,000), representing an increase of approximately 17.9% during the
Period.
Cost-Saving measures
The Group devoted much effort to supporting revenue growth during the Period, and expenses grew
correspondingly with increasing sales. As a common practice, the Group continued to monitor
expenditure growth during the Period. Selling expenses, excluding payment processing fees,
amounted to approximately US$8.8 million for the Period (Prior Period: US$7.5 million), representing
an increase of 18.6% and an incremental rate lower than the revenue growth of 44.1%.
In addition, administrative staff costs decreased to approximately US$8.1 million during the Period
(Prior Period: US$9.1 million), falling by approximately 10.6% as compared to the Prior Period.

Outlook
Mr. Lau Kwok Chu, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of YesAsia, commented, “We are
delighted by the outstanding results for the first half of the year, especially in our fast-growing beauty
segment. The beauty industry has not only become an integral part of people's daily lives but also a
cultural sensation, with Korean beauty products captivating hearts worldwide. This synergy of quality
and cultural allure has raised the global K-Beauty market into a flourishing realm, an undeniable
opportunity, and a pivotal driver for our Group's success.
As our revenue continues to surge, our operational efficiency remains paramount on our agenda.
We've embarked on a journey to streamline our processes and enhance our operations. In addition to
our newly implemented CRM system, we deployed 161 autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in our
Smart Robotics Warehouse, a leap that took place in October 2022. This strategic move positions us
to harness cost-saving benefits as order volume climbs, promising an even brighter trajectory in the
years ahead.
The e-commerce landscape has seen its fluctuations, particularly as we transitioned from the throes of
the pandemic. Our forward-thinking strategies anticipated this shift as lockdowns eased and people
embraced a more mobile lifestyle. This foresight ensured that we remained on the right track, aligning
our efforts with the evolving market dynamics. In the spirit of transformation, I'm proud to report that
we've made significant strides in the first half of 2023. We remain committed to executing our business
strategy with diligence and determination to pursue steady business growth and to expand profitability
for the rest of 2023 and in coming years.”
