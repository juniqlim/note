MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The Group has continued to record a strong revenue growth in the first half of 2025, attributable to the increase in

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Rapid growth in global B2B market, and offline footprint
–

In January 2025, the Group appointed Mr. Howon Song as the new Chief Executive Officer of ABW (“ABW
CEO”) to bolster its expansion into the international wholesale market, and offline retail network. With 11
years of global B2B experience under his belt, the new ABW CEO takes the lead of the newly established
ABW office in Korea and its new sales team of over 15 members, together with the new B2B sales team
in Hong Kong, focusing on enhancing brand appeal, and forging new partnership. The Group has also
set up a 147,000 square feet warehouse in Korea to support the rapid growth in the B2B segment. The
warehouse in Korea has commenced operation since April 2025.

–

ABW also made a debut at Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna 2025, a prestigious global annual event in the
beauty industry with over 50 years of history, drawing over 300,000 professionals, distributors and industry
leaders every year. Over the three-day event, ABW engaged with more than 800 B2B buyers from across
the world, including Europe, U.S., Latin America, and the Middle East. Visitors explored a curated selection

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Social media marketing efforts
Social media marketing is essential to our expansion strategy across the board. It generates demand for K-Beauty
products as content marketing and influencer marketing have an increasingly profound impact on consumers in
the digitalised economy.
As one of the first in the market to heavily invest in social media marketing, the Group had:
–

increased the number of YesStyle TikTok Influencers to approximately 132,000 at the end of June 2025 (Prior
Period: 87,000), representing a growth of approximately 51.7%.

–

generated US$44,644,000 in revenue from influencer referrals, (Prior Period: US$33,934,000), representing
a growth of approximately 31.6%.

During the Reporting Period, the Group had expanded its talent pool by strengthening the marketing teams in its
Hong Kong and Berlin offices. It had also rolled out the Euro Supporter Program:
In April 2025, YesStyle has collaborated with global K-beauty brand COSRX to launch the brand’s first ‘Euro
Supporters’ program. The initiative will recruit 100 creators from across five European markets – the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, who will then create their own content to share their authentic
skincare journeys on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. On top of product access and brand exposure,
selected content creators will also receive exclusive rewards throughout the program, such as YESSTYLE Gold
Membership, bonus gifts, and a trip to Korea.
Logistics update: the launch of second AMR warehouse in Hong Kong
In May 2025, the Group had launched its second Autonomous Mobile Robotics (AMR) warehouse, Mapletree
Smart Robotics Warehouse, in Tsing Yi, Hong Kong with floor area of approximately 147,000 square feet and
equipped with 240 AMRs. This facility marked the largest deployment of AMR technology in Hong Kong’s
e-commerce sector, following the success of the Group’s first smart warehouse, which debuted in 2022. With two
AMR warehouses now operational, the Group now boasts one of Asia’s most advanced e-commerce logistics
networks, consolidating its position in the global K-beauty market. The deployment of over 400 AMRs in the 2 AMR
warehouses directly supports surging global demand, as the K-beauty sector is projected to grow from US$12.54
billion (2023) to US$25.98 billion by 2032 at 8.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The total investment for
setting up Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse amounted to approximately US$10,909,000, comprising capital
expenditure of approximately US$8,391,000 and pre-operating expenses of approximately US$2,518,000.

10

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2025

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

These initiatives are essential to maintain the sustainability of the Group’s business growth, provide new drive
engines for revenue and is vital to enable the Group to process orders received promptly. In particular, we invested
in these new initiatives during the Reporting Period, including:
(i)

rent and associated expenses for leasing of Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse of approximately
US$2,335,000;

(ii)

rent for new warehouse in Korea of approximately US$278,000;

(iii)

stock option expense amounted to approximately US$1,734,000 for grant of stock options to the new ABW
CEO; and

(iv)

expenses for participation of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna beauty fair of approximately US$426,000.

The Group will continue to invest in various initiatives for business development. Consequently, the net profit
margin of the Group for the Reporting Period was 5.8% (Prior Period: 6.8%). Nonetheless, the net profit margin for
the Reporting Period exceeded the net profit margins of approximately 4.4% and 5.5% for the second half of 2024
and the full year of 2024 respectively.

PROSPECTS
We would like to express our appreciation to our colleagues, partners, and customers for another record breaking
half-year results in 2025 1H.
K-beauty has first taken the world by storm in 2015, and the momentum is still going strong. In fact, there is great
room for growth as K-beauty becomes increasingly mainstream across the global beauty community.
Looking forward, we are optimistic about the prospects of YesStyle and ABW as it continues to push forward its
global expansion in both retail and wholesale.
The global momentum of K-Beauty
K-Beauty is not a fad, but an increasingly prominent player in the global beauty industry. According to the data
from the Korean International Trade Association (KITA), Korea’s cosmetics exports have elevated to second
place globally this year – pushing ahead of the United States for the first time while trailing the traditional industry
powerhouse France. From 2025 January to April, Korea exported US$3.61 billion worth of cosmetics, overtaking
the United States’ US$3.57 billion.
This followed the upward movement in the global cosmetics exports league table last year, where Korea outpaced
Germany to become the world’s third-largest exporter after France and the US.
The rise of K-beauty is more prominent in non-English speaking markets in Europe and the Middle East,
particularly in Poland: according to data from KITA, exports to Poland rocketed 121 per cent to US$111.8 million
during the first five months of 2025, up from US$50.4 million for same period in 2024. Exports to the United Arab
Emirates, on the other hand, also increased 74% year-on-year during the same period in 2024 from US$57 million
to US$99.3 million. Other European markets, such as Ireland and Belgium, also saw significant growth.
The growth trajectory of K-Beauty underpins our overall global expansion strategy across both retail and wholesale.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Expansion of K-Beauty’s footprint in offline shops
The offline presence of K-Beauty has been growing in high street stores across the world, including US, UK,
Europe, Latin America, and etc, since the strong online presence of K-Beauty products is gradually amassing to
spill over to offline, physical stores. In the US, Ulta is expanding its K-Beauty selection across stores. In the UK,
retailers such as Primark (off-price) and Superdrug (pharmaceutical) have begun carrying K-Beauty products.
Across the European Union, fashion retailer such as OVS in ltaly – with over 1,300 stores – has introduced K-Beauty
to its offerings. In Spain, MiiN stands out as a specialized K-Beauty retailer, operating more than 40 stores. In Latin
America, beauty retailer Pichara, with over 120 stores in Chile and Peru, has also embraced K-Beauty. Meanwhile,
in Thailand, convenience store chain 7-Eleven has started stocking K-Beauty products, reflecting the category’s
growing global reach.
The trend has profound implication for the market potential of K-Beauty products since the majority of retail
purchases still take place in offline stores, and online shops of local stores. It also echoes the Group’s expansion
into B2B business through ABW, which had formed a successful partnership with TJX and Burlington, which in
aggregate have more than 2,400 stores in the US, to curate a wide range of K-Beauty products across its shops
in the US. The Group is also in talks with major high street shops and retailers in US, UK, Europe, Middle East, and
Asia, where its local social media KOLs have already been creating engaging content to curate their unique K-Beauty
stories.
The power of story-telling: social media marketing
The rise of K-Beauty has been part of the wave of K-Pop culture that has taken the world by storm. There is a
unique cultural differentiation to K-Beauty products, and its global audiences relate to K-Beauty products – and the
wider K-Pop culture, in their own way depending on their demographics, and cultural background.
Social media marketing, therefore, plays an essential role in promoting a K-Beauty in a way that resonate with its
target audience and cement the bond. It is also why the Group has been committed to investing in its influencer
program, engaging international KOLs in producing stories on their K-beauty stories from their local perspective.
The data and consumer feedback collected through social media platforms are also invaluable for AI and datadriven consumer engagement.
Business agility: supply chain management and warehouse capacities
Another fascinating differentiator of K-Beauty products is the speed at which they innovate and produce new
products. To fully realize and monetarize this unique strength in a global context, K-beauty brands must find a way
to curate those new innovations, tap into the audience, and swiftly deliver the very product to their hands.
The Group offers the one-stop solution to K-Beauty brands – its social marketing capabilities are matched by
its agile supply chain and warehouse solutions. With its second AMR warehouse in Hong Kong, the Group now
boasts one of Asia’s most advanced e-commerce logistics networks. Its additional warehouses in Hong Kong, US,
South Korea, UK, and Germany, on the other hand, provide support for its B2B expansion. These infrastructures
not only help shorten delivery time and lower transportation costs, but also increase the scalability of the Group to
respond to the rapid surge in customer demand.

percentage points to approximately 50.2% during the Reporting Period from approximately 47.3% in the Prior
Period. This was mainly because of the increase in the weighting of revenue from AsianBeautyWholesale which
has a lower markup as it is a wholesale business.

Selling Expenses
The Group’s selling expenses during the Reporting Period were approximately US$28,703,000 (Prior Period:
US$18,642,000), representing an increase of approximately US$10,061,000 or 54.0% as compared to that for the
Prior Period. Nevertheless, selling expenses as percentage of revenue remained flat at approximately 11.8% (Prior
Period: 11.4%) for the Reporting Period. The increase in selling expenses was mainly attributable to the following:
•

approximately US$5,272,000 or 65.2% increase in marketing and promotion fees due to increase in beauty
products-focused promotion and expenses for participation of Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna beauty fair
of approximately US$426,000;

•

approximately US$2,230,000 or 75.9% increase in outsourced warehouse labour charges;

•

approximately US$1,284,000 or 31.5% in payment gateway charges which was in line with the revenue
growth;

•

approximately US$685,000 or 128.5% increase in customs duties mainly due to increase in sales in regions
such as Mexico and Middle East and tariffs for shipments of inventories to our US warehouse ; and

•

approximately US$325,000 or 14.7% increase in warehouse wages.

With the increase in revenue and sales order volume during the Reporting Period, warehouse wages and
outsourced warehouse labour charges (collectively “warehouse labour cost”) in aggregate during the Reporting
Period increased by approximately 49.6% as compared to the Prior Period, while warehouse labour cost as a

of Prior Period. Nevertheless, administrative expenses as percentage of revenue dropped to 10.9% (Prior Period:
11.2%) for the Reporting Period. The increase in administrative expenses was mainly attributable to the following:
•

approximately US$4,043,000 or 38.2% increase in staff costs as (i) the number of administrative
employees increased from 385 as at 30 June 2024 to 452 as at 30 June 2025; (ii) accrual of approximately
US$1,292,000 of bonuses (Prior Period: US$1,820,000); and (iii) share option expenses of approximately
US$1,950,000 (Prior Period: US$103,000);

approximately US$1,742,000 or 72.4% increase in depreciation of right-of-use assets due to the newly
leased Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse;

payment gateway as a result of revenue increase during the Reporting Period;

•

approximately US$547,000 or 82.9% increase in rates and management fee, mainly due to the newly
leased Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse;

•

approximately US$368,000 or 111.9% increase in other administrative expenses which was mainly
driven by (i) the elevated stock transportation costs between Hong Kong warehouses; (ii) additional
interoffice travel expenses resulting from the establishment of new overseas offices; (iii) fees associated
with outsourced payroll services; and (iv) the increase in insurances for the renovation of Mapletree Smart
Robotics Warehouse during the Reporting Period; and

•

approximately US$244,000 or 3,485.7% increase in operating lease charges due to increase in short term
lease during the Reporting Period.

Period: US$11,107,000). The increase in profit was mainly attributable to (i) an enhancement of YesStyle Platforms’

of approximately US$27,494,000; and (ii) an increase in trade and other payables and accruals by approximately
US$5,490,000 during the Reporting Period.

US$4,847,000 repayment of principal elements of lease payments; (ii) approximately US$637,000 increase in
pledged bank fixed deposits; and (iii) approximately US$221,000 of borrowings repaid during the Reporting Period.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TREASURY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES
The Group’s treasury management policy is to avoid any investment in highly-leveraged or speculative derivative
products. The Group continued to be conservative in managing financial risk during the Reporting Period.
Consistent with the aforesaid treasury objectives and policy, the Group undertakes treasury management activities
with respect to its surplus cash assets. The selection criteria of investments include the relative risk profile
involved, the liquidity of an investment, the after-tax equivalent yield of an investment and investments that are not
speculative in nature.
Most business transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group were denominated either in US Dollar, Hong Kong
Dollar, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, and Euro. The E-commerce customers of the Group generally settle
their invoices using their designated currencies upon checkout via secure payment gateways, and the fund is
generally transferred to the Group’s account in Hong Kong Dollar and US Dollar upon currency conversion. As
Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to US Dollar, our Group does not expect any significant movements in the exchange
rate between US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars. Besides, our Group has certain exposure to foreign currency risk
as some of our business transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies (i.e. South Korean Won,
Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Euro, etc) other than the functional currency of our Group (i.e.
US Dollar).
Currently, we do not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy. However, our management monitors the
Group’s foreign exchange exposure constantly and will consider engaging in derivatives markets or foreign
exchange hedging measures to minimise the foreign exchange risk when it is foreseen to be significant.

GEARING RATIO
Our gearing ratio, calculated by the total interest-bearing liabilities (including lease liabilities) divided by total
equity, increased from approximately 43.0% as at 31 December 2024 to approximately 59.9% as at 30 June
2025, primarily due to the increase in (i) bank borrowings and (ii) lease liabilities for the Mapletree Smart Robotics
Warehouse, which is set for operation in May 2025.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
As at 30 June 2025, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities (31 December 2024: Nil).

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Saved for those disclosed in Note 21 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information, the Group did
not have any significant capital commitments as at 30 June 2025.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELD
During the Reporting Period, the Group held 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics, representing approximately 0.4%
of the issued share capital of CN Logistics as at 30 June 2025, with a fair value amounted to approximately
US$485,000 as at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: US$489,000). The investment represents approximately
0.3% of the total consolidated asset of the Group as at 30 June 2025 (31 December 2024: 0.4%). The
aforementioned 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics were subscribed by the Company at a total cash consideration
of HK$10,120,000. The principal activity of CN Logistics is investment holding, which through its subsidiaries,
is principally engaged in the provision of air freight forwarding services and distribution and logistics services in
relation to fashion products and fine wine, primarily focusing on high-end fashion (including luxury and affordable
luxury) products. CN Logistics is a strategic logistics partner of the Group for delivery of our customers’ products
to the US, Europe and other overseas markets.
As at 30 June 2025, the unrealised fair value loss of such investment was approximately US$4,000 due to the
decrease in share price of CN Logistics during the Reporting Period from preceding reporting date. A dividend of
approximately US$2,000 had been recognised from the investment during the Reporting Period. In view of the
expected positive impact to the businesses of both CN Logistics and the Group through the strategic logistics
partnership and the deepened collaboration during the Reporting Period, the investment in CN Logistics is
expected to be strategic and enable the Group to foster a closer business partnership with CN Logistics for a
longer term and result in potential investment returns to the Shareholders.

Executive Officer of the Group and an executive Director, which is considered as financial assets of our Group.
Under the policy, the beneficiary and the policy holder is YesStyle.com Limited and the total insured sum is
approximately US$4,447,000. The fair value of investment in life insurance policies is determined by reference to
the cash surrender value as provided by the insurance company.
As at 30 June 2025, the life insurance policy was pledged to a bank to secure banking facilities of our Group.
For the Reporting Period, the fair value loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss amounted
to approximately US$443,000. As at 30 June 2025, the fair value of the life insurance policy amounted to
approximately US$4,004,000.
Save as disclosed for above, the Group did not hold any significant investments as at 30 June 2025.

The Company adopted a share option scheme on 30 June 2016 (“2016 Share Option Scheme”) for the purpose
of enabling the Company to attract and retain qualified employees by providing them with an opportunity for
investment in the Company. The Company may grant options under the 2016 Share Option Scheme only to
employees of the Company. As the Company became listed on the Stock Exchange on 9 July 2021, no further

expiration of the scheme would remain effective, and the expiration of the 2016 Share Option Scheme would not
result in the termination of any options already granted.
There is no maximum entitlement of each participant specified under the 2016 Share Option Scheme. The exercise
price of options granted under the 2016 Share Option Scheme shall be determined by the Board but shall not be
less than 85% of the fair market value of the Shares as at the grant date.
Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the 2016 Share Option Scheme.

OTHER INFORMATION

Post-IPO Share Option Scheme
A post-IPO share option scheme was adopted by the Company on 13 March 2021, which was conditional upon
the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange and came into effect on 9 July 2021 (the “Post-IPO Share
Option Scheme”). The Post-IPO Share Option Scheme shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years
from the date of the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange until 8 July 2031. The purpose of the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company
to attract and retain qualified employees or directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries through providing
them with an opportunity for investment in the shares of the Company. Participants of the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme include any individual, being an employee or director of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries
who the Board or its delegate(s) considers, in their sole discretion, to have contributed or will contribute to
the business performance of the Group. However, no individual who is a resident in a place where the grant,
acceptance or exercise of options pursuant to the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is not permitted under the laws
and regulations of such place or where, in the view of the Board or its delegate(s), compliance with applicable laws
and regulations in such place makes it necessary or expedient to exclude such individual from the grant or offer of
such options.
The total number of Shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options to be granted under the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is 39,539,079, being the maximum 10% of the Shares in issue on the date the Shares
commence trading on the Stock Exchange (the “Option Scheme Mandate Limit”) (excluding any Shares which
may be issued pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Pre-IPO Share Option
Scheme). Options which have lapsed in accordance with the terms of the rules of the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme (or any other share option schemes of the Company) shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating
the Option Scheme Mandate Limit.
Unless approved by the Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of
the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme and any other share option
scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised and outstanding options) in
any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any
further grant of options to a selected participant which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued
and to be issued upon exercise of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including
exercised, canceled and outstanding options) in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such further
grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of the Shareholders (with such selected
participant and his associates abstaining from voting). There was no option granted under such circumstances
during the Reporting Period.

28

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2025

OTHER INFORMATION

Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme.
The subscription price, being the amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option, in the
event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than the greater of:
(i)

the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock Exchange on the
date of grant;

(ii)

the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and

(iii)

the nominal value of the Shares on the date of grant.

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no grantee shall in any way
sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or create any interest in favor of or enter into
any agreement with any other person over or in relation to any option.
Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the Company (or any of
their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent non-executive Directors (excluding any
independent non-executive Director who is a proposed recipient of the grant of options).
In addition, where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive Director
of the Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of Shares issued and to be
issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted (including options exercised, canceled and
outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such grant:
(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii)

having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets
issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess of HK$5,000,000 (or such other higher
amount as may from time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way of poll) in a general
meeting. In obtaining the approval, the Company shall send a circular to the Shareholders in accordance with and
containing such information as is required under the Listing Rules. All core connected persons of the Company
shall abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any core connected person may vote against the
relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been stated in the circular to be
sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith. There was no option granted under such circumstances during
the Reporting Period.

The Company has no ultimate holding company, and ultimate controlling shareholders of the Company are

The financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2024 that is included in the interim

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CHANGES TO THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The unaudited interim condensed financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2025 has been
prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Accounting Standard 34 (“HKAS 34”) Interim Financial Reporting
issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”), as well as with the
applicable disclosures required by the Listing Rules.
The interim condensed consolidated financial information does not include all of the information and
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the
Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024, which have been prepared in
accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”).
The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial information requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2024.
In the current period, the Group has adopted all the new and revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting
Standards issued by the HKICPA that are relevant to its operations and effective for its accounting year
beginning on 1 January 2025 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning
after 1 January 2025 and earlier application is permitted. The Group has not adopted in advance any of
the forthcoming new or amended standards in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following disclosures of fair value
measurements use a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value:
Level 1 inputs:

quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs:

inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs:

unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of any of the three levels as of the date of
the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Disclosures of level in fair value hierarchy:

Notes:
(i)

When the Group receives the payment in full before the goods is shipped/delivered, this will give rise
to contract liabilities at the start of a contract, until the revenue recognised when the goods is shipped/
delivered to the customers.

(ii)

Contract liabilities relating to deferred revenue for loyalty programme are a portion of the transaction price
allocated to the memberships based on the relative stand-alone selling price.

(iii)

Store credit is a type of refund offered by the Group to a customer who returns an item that allows them
to purchase something in the Group up to the value of a returned item. Store credit would be valid for 2
years upon the grant date.

The decrease in the contract liabilities balances during the period ended 30 June 2025 were mainly due to
the implementation of the Group’s Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse which increased the fulfillment
efficiency, allowing more orders to be delivered.
Except the store credits which would be valid for 2 years upon the grant date, all of the remaining contract
liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue within one year.

Period: US$106,000) in respect of the share option schemes.
