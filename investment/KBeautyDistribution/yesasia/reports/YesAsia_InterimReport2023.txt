MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
During the Reporting Period, the Group recorded revenue of approximately US$90,657,000 (Prior Period:
US$62,905,000), a historical high for our first-half revenue representing an increase of approximately 44.1% as
compared to the Prior Period, which was mainly driven by the rise in sales of beauty products via both YesStyle
Platforms and AsianBeautyWholesale. With revenue growth on track, we achieved a turnaround from net losses
in year 2021 and 2022 to a net profit of approximately US$1,563,000 for the Reporting Period (Prior Period:
US$2,264,000 loss).
Fashion & Lifestyle and Beauty Products
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) platforms (YesStyle Platforms)
Since January 2023, YesStyle Platforms have introduced a new front page and a beauty products-focused
promotion strategy. Revenue from YesStyle Platforms was approximately US$71,450,000 during the Reporting
Period (Prior Period: US$54,146,000), representing an increase of approximately 32.0% as compared to the Prior
Period, which was driven by rising sales of beauty products.
Business-to-Business (B2B) platform (AsianBeautyWholesale)
AsianBeautyWholesale continued to grow quickly during the Reporting Period. With the growth of number of
customers, number of orders and average order size by approximately 174.8%, 212.7% and 34.3% respectively
during the Reporting Period as compared to the Prior Period, revenue from AsianBeautyWholesale during the
Reporting Period rose to approximately US$17,423,000 (Prior Period: US$4,174,000), representing an increase of
approximately 317.4% as compared to the Prior Period.
Products
Beauty products, in particular Korean beauty (“K-Beauty”) products, were also a main driver of revenue growth
during the Reporting Period. The revenue contributed from beauty products as a percentage of the total revenue
earned increased from approximately 50.1% during the Prior Period to approximately 77.0% during the Reporting
Period. We continued to foster closer relationships with our K-Beauty partners. As of 30 June 2023, we have
partnered with 452 K-Beauty brands (31 December 2022: 430), representing an increase of approximately
5.1%. In addition, we further strengthened our partnerships with two popular K-Beauty companies, Amorepacific
Corporation and CJ Olive Young Corporation. We added to our E-commerce platforms one more brand from
Amorepacific Corporation, espoir, and 5 more brands under CJ Olive Young Corporation, namely IDEAL FOR
MEN, fillimilli, colorgram, ROUND A’ROUND and BIOHEAL BOH.
YesStyle Influencer Program
The YesStyle Influencer Program showed strong growth during the Reporting Period. With the launch of a new
loyalty program for influencers in May 2022, and more programs and incentives offered to motivate influencer
performance, the total number of unique influencers grew to approximately 311,000 by the end of June 2023 (31
December 2022: 279,000), representing an increase of approximately 11.4% as compared to 31 December 2022.
In particular, the number of YesStyle TikTok Influencers reached 60,000 at the end of June 2023 (31 December
2022: 44,000), representing a rapid growth of approximately 36.4% since 31 December 2022.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

We continued to partner with influencers to create interesting videos and posts on various platforms, including
Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, etc., which increased YesStyle’s exposure and drove revenue. During the
Reporting Period, revenue generated from influencer referrals amounted to approximately US$15,769,000
(Prior Period: US$9,349,000), representing an increase of approximately 68.7% as compared to the Prior
Period. Revenue generated from influencer referrals as a percentage of YesStyle Platforms revenue increased to
approximately 22.1% during the Reporting Period from approximately 17.3% for the Prior Period, demonstrating
the continuous success of the YesStyle Influencer Program.
Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) System
The CRM System was effective at enhancing the customer retention rate, increasing a sustainable source
of revenue from existing customers. Revenue facilitated by the CRM System amounted to approximately
US$11,524,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$5,640,000). In addition, the number of YesStyle
loyalty program members grew to approximately 9,749,000 as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: 8,272,000),
representing an increase of approximately 17.9% during the Reporting Period.
Entertainment Products
For YesAsia, revenue contributed from our entertainment products for the Reporting Period fell by approximately
69.6% as compared to the Prior Period. The decrease was mainly due to a lack of popular new releases during the
Reporting Period.
The Group has ceased its offline wholesale of entertainment products since January 2023 and has since refocused
its resources on the development of its online platform business.
Logistics Services
With written contracts secured with two external customers, the revenue contributed from our logistics services
amounted to approximately US$605,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$325,000).
Cost Saving Measures
While we have devoted much effort to support revenue growth, expenses grew correspondingly with increasing
sales during the Reporting Period. In line with previous periods, we have continued to monitor our expenditure
growth during the Reporting Period. Our selling expenses, excluding payment gateway charges, amounted to
approximately US$8,844,000 for the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$7,454,000), representing an increase of
18.6% with a growth rate of 44.1% during the Reporting Period which is lower than the growth rate of the revenue
of the Group during the same period.
In addition, our administrative staff costs decreased to approximately US$8,107,000 during the Reporting Period
(Prior Period: US$9,073,000), falling by approximately 10.6% as compared to the Prior Period. This was the result
of an administrative headcount reduction to 373 team members as at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: 401), as part
of our cost saving measures.

OUTLOOK
Despite the uncertainties and challenges from the macroeconomic and political factors, the Group will continue
to adjust its strategies and review new business opportunities with the goal towards improving the Shareholders’
returns.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2023

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

After the COVID pandemic, beauty products reverted to being a daily essential for people. Besides their quality,
K-Beauty products have grown in demand due to the influence of Korea’s cultural exports. With the combination
of these two factors, the growing K-Beauty product market globally remains an opportunity and a key driver to the
Group’s business.
With the increasing revenue growth, operational efficiency will continue to be one of the priorities for the Group.
Due to the deployment of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in the Smart Robotics Warehouse in October 2022,
we expect to gain cost-saving benefits from increasing order volume in the coming years.
As mentioned previously in our “Letter to Shareholders” in the Company’s 2022 annual report, our team is
determined and dedicated to revive the growth of and achieve profitability for the Company. We are pleased to
report that we made good progress in the first half of 2023, and will continue to execute the business strategy
diligently.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
REVENUE
Our Group’s revenue grew to approximately US$90,657,000 by approximately US$27,752,000 or 44.1% as
compared to approximately US$62,905,000 for the Prior Period, which was mainly driven by a rise in sales of
beauty products via both YesStyle Platforms and AsianBeautyWholesale. The increase was mainly attributable to
(i) the introduction of a new front page and a beauty products-focused promotion strategy for YesStyle Platforms
since January 2023, (ii) an enhancement of YesStyle Platforms’ marketing efforts to promote the sale of beauty
products, and (iii) the expansion of AsianBeautyWholesale to serve more business-to-business (B2B) customers
looking to source Asian beauty products globally.
During the Reporting Period, the revenue of AsiaBeautyWholesale grew by approximately US$13,249,000 or
317.4% to approximately US$17,423,000 (Prior Period: US$4,174,000). The rise in revenue of AsiaBeautyWholesale
during the Reporting Period was mainly due to increases in (i) average order size by approximately 34.3%; (ii)
number of orders by approximately 212.7%; and (iii) number of customers by approximately 174.8% during the
Reporting Period as compared to the Prior Period.
During the Reporting Period, the revenue of YesAsia Platform decreased by approximately US$2,699,000 or
69.6% to approximately US$1,179,000 (Prior Period: US$3,878,000). The fall in entertainment product revenue
during the Reporting Period was mainly due to the lack of popular new releases during the Reporting Period.
During the Reporting Period, the logistics services business contributed approximately US$605,000 to the Group’s
revenue (Prior Period: US$325,000). The Group expects that the new business can diversify the customer base
and better utilise the Group’s warehouse labour after the launch of the Smart Robotics Warehouse to generate
revenue from new sources.

increase of approximately US$21,348,000 or 51.9%, as compared to approximately US$41,127,000 during the
Prior Period. The increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the increase in revenue during the Reporting Period.
With the recovery of logistics capacity and availability of flights after the COVID pandemic, coupled with the
increase in use of ocean shipments rather than air freights for inwards deliveries, freight charges as a percentage
of revenue dropped to 22.0% for the Reporting Period (Prior Period: 25.1%).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN
The gross profit margin of the Group decreased by approximately 3.5 percentage points to approximately 31.1%
(Prior Period: approximately 34.6%). It was mainly due to an increase in the weighting of revenue from (i) products
of AsianBeautyWholesale, which had lower markups due to AsianBeautyWholesale’s B2B nature; and (ii) beauty
products of YesStyle Platforms, which had lower margins as compared to fashion and lifestyle products. The
decrease in gross margin for YesAsia Platform to approximately 5.4% during the Reporting Period (Prior Period:
20.8%) was mainly due to the charging of allowance for inventories of approximately US$173,000 for certain Bluray products identified as slow-moving in accordance with our inventory provision policy.
Moreover, the gross profit of the Group for the Reporting Period was approximately US$28,182,000, representing
an increase of approximately US$6,404,000 or 29.4% as compared to approximately US$21,778,000 for the Prior
Period.

OTHER INCOME AND OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES
Our other income and other gains decreased by 79.0% from approximately US$582,000 during the Prior Period to
approximately US$122,000 during the Reporting Period. The decrease was primarily attributable to (i) the absence
of one-off government subsidy from the Employment Support Scheme received during the Reporting Period (Prior
Period: US$421,000); and (ii) cash rebate income received decreased by approximately US$43,000 or 66.2% to
approximately US$22,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$65,000), partially offset by an increase in
interest income to approximately US$79,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior Period: US$59,000).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SELLING EXPENSES
The Group devoted much effort to support revenue growth and expansion in scale with sales of the Group during
the Reporting Period, which is expected to increase its unaudited selling expenses by approximately US$2,072,000
or 22.8% to approximately US$11,146,000 during the Reporting Period as compared to approximately
US$9,074,000 during the Prior Period. The increase mainly comprised (i) marketing and promotion fees increased
by approximately US$1,042,000 or 32.0% to approximately US$4,296,000 (Prior Period: US$3,254,000) which
was mainly due to more marketing campaigns and promotional activities to acquire new customers and repeat
orders; (ii) payment gateway charges increased by approximately US$682,000 or 42.1% to approximately
US$2,302,000 (Prior Period: US$1,620,000) which was in line with revenue growth; and (iii) outsourced warehouse
labour cost increased by approximately US$309,000 or 29.5% to approximately US$1,358,000 (Prior Period:
US$1,049,000) which was due to an increase in outsourced labour for fulfilling the substantial growth in orders.
Despite the increase in the amount of outsourced warehouse labour charges and warehouse wages during the
Reporting Period as compared to the Prior Period, the percentage of outsourced warehouse labour charges
and warehouse wages in aggregate to revenue was approximately 3.9% (Prior Period: 5.1%), which was lower
than the Prior Period by approximately 1.2 percentage points. This is mainly attributable to the deployment of the
AMR since October 2022 that lowered both the outsourced warehouse labour charges and warehouse wages,
in particular for the fulfillments of orders for YesStyle Platforms, during the Reporting Period. The Group has
continued to fine-tune the AMR system to further enhance its efficiency and bring in more benefits to the Group’s
operations.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
The Group’s administrative expenses for the Reporting Period were approximately US$14,563,000 (Prior
Period: US$15,147,000), representing a decrease of approximately 3.9% as compared to the Prior Period. The
decrease was mainly due to (i) a decrease of approximately US$966,000 or 10.6% in staff costs as the number of
administrative employees was reduced from 401 as at 30 June 2022 to 373 as at 30 June 2023; (ii) a decrease in
depreciation of right-of-use assets by approximately US$396,000 or 14.7% to approximately US$2,291,000 (Prior
Period: US$2,687,000); and (iii) a decrease in operating lease charges by approximately US$119,000 or 70.0%
to approximately US$51,000 (Prior Period: US$170,000) which was due to lease modification, partially offset by (i)
approximately US$648,000 or a 235.6% increase in net exchange losses which was mainly due to more payments
settled by our payment gateway as a result of revenue growth during the Reporting Period; and (ii) approximately
US$76,000 or a 271.4% increase in staff training and recruitment expenses.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

FINANCE COSTS
The Group’s finance costs for the Reporting Period were approximately US$642,000 (Prior Period: US$225,000),
representing an increase of approximately 185.3% as compared to the Prior Period, reflecting a full six months
lease interest expensed during the Reporting Period for the new warehouse whose lease started in the Prior
Period.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
Income tax expense for the Reporting Period was approximately US$319,000 (Prior Period: US$37,000),
representing an increase of approximately US$282,000 or 762.2% as compared to the Prior Period. The increase
was mainly due to the higher taxable profit generated during the Reporting Period.
PROFIT/(LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD
As a result of the foregoing, a profit of approximately US$1,563,000 was recorded for the Reporting Period (Prior
Period: US$2,264,000 loss). The turnaround was mainly attributable to (i) the introduction of a new front page and
the beauty products-focused promotion strategy of YesStyle Platforms since January 2023; (ii) an enhancement
of the marketing efforts of YesStyle Platforms to promote the sale of beauty products; (iii) the expansion of
AsianBeautyWholesale to serve more business-to-business (B2B) customers looking to source Asian beauty
products globally; and (iv) the results yielded from our enhanced cost saving measures, in particular, the labour
cost savings and improvement in operational efficiency gained after the deployment of the AMRs.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
During the Reporting Period, the Group acquired plant and equipment of approximately US$252,000 (Prior Period:
US$76,000), representing an increase of approximately US$176,000 or 231.6% as compared to that for the Prior
Period.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal source of liquidity was cash from operations and the proceeds from Listing. As of 30 June
2023, the Group’s bank and cash balances amounted to approximately US$9,885,000 (31 December 2022:
US$18,797,000).
Our bank and cash balance were mainly denominated in US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Korean Won, British
Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Euro and Renminbi which decreased by approximately US$8,912,000 during the
Reporting Period which was attributable to (i) net cash used in operating activities of approximately US$7,993,000;
(ii) principal elements of lease payments of approximately US$2,208,000; and (iii) purchase of property, plant and
equipment of approximately US$252,000, partially offset by decrease in pledged bank deposits approximately
US$1,535,000.
The net cash used in operating activities was mainly due to operating profit before working capital changes of
approximately US$6,050,000 during the Reporting Period, offset by (i) an increase in inventories by approximately
US$8,445,000; (ii) an increase in prepayments, deposits and other receivables by approximately US$2,358,000;
(iii) a decrease in trade and other payables and accruals by approximately US$1,819,000; and (iv) a decrease in
contract liabilities by approximately US$1,417,000.
As at 30 June 2023, the Group had no bank borrowing (31 December 2022: Nil).

14

YesAsia Holdings Limited Interim Report 2023

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

We believe that our liquidity requirements and our expected source of funding going forward will be satisfied by using
a combination of cash generated from our operations and net proceeds from Listing.

TREASURY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES
The Group’s treasury management policy is to avoid any investment in highly-leveraged or speculative derivative
products. The Group continued to be conservative in managing financial risk during the Reporting Period.
Consistent with the aforesaid treasury objectives and policy, the Group undertakes treasury management activities
with respect to its surplus cash assets. The selection criteria of investments include the relative risk profile
involved, the liquidity of an investment, the after-tax equivalent yield of an investment and investments that are not
speculative in nature.
Most business transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group were denominated either in US Dollar, Hong Kong
Dollar, Korean Won, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Euro or Renminbi. The E-commerce customers of
the Group generally settle their invoices using their designated currencies upon checkout via secure payment
gateways, and the fund is generally transferred to the Group’s account in Hong Kong Dollar and US Dollar upon
currency conversion. As Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to US Dollar, our Group does not expect any significant
movements in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars. Besides, our Group has certain
exposure to foreign currency risk as some of our business transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated
in currencies (i.e. Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Euro, etc) other than the
functional currency of our Group (i.e. US Dollar).
Currently, we do not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy. However, our management monitors the
Group’s foreign exchange exposure constantly and will consider engaging in derivatives markets or foreign
exchange hedging measures to minimise the foreign exchange risk when it is foreseen to be significant.

GEARING RATIO
Our gearing ratio, calculated by the total interest-bearing liabilities (including lease liabilities) divided by total equity,
decreased from approximately 57.0% as at 31 December 2022 to approximately 47.9% as at 30 June 2023,
primarily due to amortisation of lease liabilities during the Reporting Period.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
As at 30 June 2023, the Group did not have any material contingent liabilities (31 December 2022: Nil).

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Saved for those disclosed in Note 19 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information, the Group did
not have any significant capital commitments as at 30 June 2023.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELD
During the Reporting Period, we did not hold any significant investments, save for the 1,100,000 shares in CN
Logistics, representing approximately 0.40% of the issued share capital of CN Logistics as at 30 June 2023, with
a fair value amounted to approximately US$1,121,000 as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: US$1,191,000).
The investment represents approximately 1.8% of the total consolidated asset of the Group as at 30 June 2023 (31
December 2022: 1.9%). The aforementioned 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics were subscribed by the Company
at a total cash consideration of HK$10,120,000. The principal activity of CN Logistics is investment holding, which
through its subsidiaries, is principally engaged in the provision of air freight forwarding services and distribution and
logistics services in relation to fashion products and fine wine, primarily focusing on high-end fashion (including
luxury and affordable luxury) products. CN Logistics is a strategic logistics partner of the Group for delivery of our
customers’ products to the US, Europe and other overseas markets.
As at 30 June 2023, the unrealised fair value loss of such investment was approximately US$70,000 due to the
decrease in share price of CN Logistics during the Reporting Period from our subscription price of HK$9.20 per
share. A dividend of approximately US$14,000 had been recognised from the investment during the Reporting
Period. In view of the expected positive impact to the business of both CN Logistics and the Group through the
strategic logistics partnership and the deepened collaboration during the Reporting Period, the investment in
CN Logistics is expected to be strategic and enable the Group to foster a closer business partnership with CN
Logistics for a longer term and result in potential investment returns to the Shareholders.

INTERIM DIVIDEND
The Board has resolved not to declare any interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (Prior Period:
Nil).

FUTURE PLANS FOR MATERIAL INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL ASSETS
Except as disclosed herein and apart from investment for operation purposes which may be made in the ordinary
and usual course of business, as of the date of this report, the Group did not have any concrete immediate
future plans for material investments or capital assets but the Group may explore potential opportunities to make
investment and/or acquire capital assets for sustainable growth.

MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS AND FUTURE PLANS FOR SUBSIDIARIES
During the Reporting Period and as of the date of this interim report, we did not have any material acquisition or
disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures nor any future plans in relation to such actions.

CHARGE ON ASSETS
As at 30 June 2023, the banking facilities of the Group mainly comprised corporate credit cards and letters of
guarantee issued to the Group and Group’s suppliers for products purchased by the Group and securing the
payments to the Group’s suppliers respectively. The banking facilities were secured by the pledged deposit of the
Group of approximately US$1,644,000 as of 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: US$3,179,000).

OTHER INFORMATION

As at 1 January 2023, the total number of Shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all
outstanding options granted under the 2016 Share Option Scheme were 20,398,190 Shares, which represented
about 5.15% of the total number of issued Shares of the Company as at 1 January 2023. As at 30 June 2023,
the total number of Shares of the Company that could be issued upon exercise of all outstanding options granted
under the 2016 Share Option Scheme were 20,001,190 Shares, which represented about 5.05% of the total
number of issued Shares of the Company as at 30 June 2023.
The default vesting schedule of the 2016 Share Option Scheme is as follows: (i) 25% of all the options granted will
become vested on the first anniversary of the Vesting Start Date and (ii) 6.25% of the options granted will become
vested as at the end of each three month period after the Vesting Start Date.
The total proceeds of US$7,440 received from the exercise of share options under the 2016 Share Option Scheme
during the Reporting Period were used as general working capital of the Company.
Please refer to Note 17 to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Information for the methodology and
assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of Options granted.
Note:
(1)

During the six months ended 30 June 2023, a total of 6,200 options were exercised under the 2016 Share Option
Scheme. The weighted average closing price of Shares immediately before 8 February 2023 (the exercise date of
6,200 Share options) was HK$0.61.

Post-IPO Share Option Scheme
A post-IPO share option scheme was adopted by the Company on 13 March 2021, which was conditional upon
the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange and came into effect on 9 July 2021 (the “Post-IPO Share
Option Scheme”). The Post-IPO Share Option Scheme shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years from
the Listing Date until 8 July 2031. The purpose of the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is to advance the interests of
the Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company to attract and retain qualified employees or directors
of the Company and/or its subsidiaries through providing them with an opportunity for investment in the shares
of the Company. Participants of the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme include any individual, being an employee or
director of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries who the Board or its delegate(s) considers, in their
sole discretion, to have contributed or will contribute to the business performance of the Group. However, no
individual who is a resident in a place where the grant, acceptance or exercise of options pursuant to the PostIPO Share Option Scheme is not permitted under the laws and regulations of such place or where, in the view of
the Board or its delegate(s), compliance with applicable laws and regulations in such place makes it necessary or
expedient to exclude such individual from the grant or offer of such options.
The total number of Shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options to be granted under the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is 39,539,079, being 10% of the Shares in issue on the date the Shares commence trading
on the Stock Exchange (the “Option Scheme Mandate Limit”) (excluding any Shares which may be issued
pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Pre-IPO Share Option Schemes). Options
which have lapsed in accordance with the terms of the rules of the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme (or any other
share option schemes of the Company) shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating the Option Scheme
Mandate Limit.

OTHER INFORMATION

Unless approved by the Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of
the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme and any other share option
scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised and outstanding options) in
any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any
further grant of options to a selected participant which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued
and to be issued upon exercise of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including
exercised, canceled and outstanding options) in the 12 month period up to and including the date of such further
grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of the Shareholders (with such selected
participant and his associates abstaining from voting). There was no option granted under such circumstances
during the Reporting Period.
Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme.
The subscription price, being the amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option, in the
event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall be not less than the greater of:
(i)

the closing price of a Share as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock Exchange on the
date of grant;

(ii)

the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and

(iii)

the nominal value of a Share on the date of grant.

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no grantee shall in any way
sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or create any interest in favor of or enter into
any agreement with any other person over or in relation to any option.
Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the Company (or any of
their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent non-executive Directors (excluding any
independent non-executive Director who is a proposed recipient of the grant of options).

OTHER INFORMATION

In addition, where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive Director
of the Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of Shares issued and to be
issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted (including options exercised, canceled and
outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such grant:
(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii)

having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets
issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess of HK$5,000,000 (or such other higher
amount as may from time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way of poll) in a general
meeting. In obtaining the approval, the Company shall send a circular to the Shareholders in accordance with and
containing such information as is required under the Listing Rules. All core connected persons of the Company
shall abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any core connected person may vote against the
relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been stated in the circular to be
sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith. There was no option granted under such circumstances during
the Reporting Period.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board has established the Audit Committee, comprising one non-executive Director, namely Mr. Hui Yat
Yan Henry and three independent non-executive Directors, namely, Mr. Wong Chee Chung (Chairman), Mr. Sin
Pak Cheong Philip Charles and Mr. Chan Yu Cheong. The primary duties of the Audit Committee are to review
and supervise our financial reporting process and the internal control system of the Group, manage risk, perform
internal audit, provide advice and comments to the Board and perform other duties and responsibilities as may be
assigned by the Board.
The interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2023 have not been

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our Company has complied with code provisions stated in the Corporate Governance Code in Appendix 14 to
the Listing Rules (the “Corporate Governance Code”) during the Reporting Period. As of 30 June 2023 and
to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of our Directors, having made all reasonable enquiries, our

the Reporting Period. Under Code Provision D.2.5, issuers should have an internal audit function.
The Group does not have an internal audit function and the Board is of the view that there is no immediate need to
set up an internal audit function within the Group having reviewed the size, nature and complexity of the Group’s
business during the Reporting Period. It was decided that the Board would be directly responsible for internal
control of the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Procedures have been designed for safeguarding assets
against unauthorised use or disposition, ensuring the maintenance of proper accounting records for the provision
of reliable financial information for internal use or for publication, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws,
rules and regulations. The situation will be reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.
Save as disclosed above, none of the Directors is aware of any information which would reasonably indicate that
the Company had not, throughout the Reporting Period, fully complied with the Code Provisions.
Our Directors will review our corporate governance policies and compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
each financial year and comply with the “comply or explain” principle in our corporate governance report, which will
be included in our annual reports.

MODEL CODE FOR SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY DIRECTORS
The Company has adopted the Model Code as its own code of conduct regarding Directors’ securities
transactions.
Specific enquiries have been made with all Directors and all of them confirmed their compliance with the
required standard set out in the Model Code and the Company’s code of conduct regarding Directors’ securities
transactions during the Reporting Period.

unless otherwise stated.
The financial information relating to the year ended 31 December 2022 that is included in the condensed
consolidated interim financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2023 as comparative
information does not constitute the Company’s statutory annual consolidated financial statements for that

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND CHANGES TO THE GROUP’S ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
The unaudited interim condensed financial information for the six months ended 30 June 2023 has been
prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Accounting Standard 34 (“HKAS 34”) Interim Financial Reporting
issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“HKICPA”), as well as with the
applicable disclosures required by the Listing Rules.
The interim condensed financial information does not include all of the information and disclosures required
in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with the Hong
Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”).
The preparation of interim condensed financial information requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of the unaudited interim condensed financial information
are consistent with those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2022.
In the current period, the Group has adopted all the new and revised Hong Kong Financial Reporting
Standards issued by the HKICPA that are relevant to its operations and effective for its accounting year
beginning on 1 January 2023 but they do not have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning
after 1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted. The Group has not adopted in advance any of
the forthcoming new or amended standards in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following disclosures of fair value
measurements use a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value:
Level 1 inputs:

quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs:

inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs:

unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of any of the three levels as of the date of
the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Disclosures of level in fair value hierarchy:

Contract liabilities in respect of deferred revenue for loyalty programme are the relevant portion of the
transaction price allocated to the memberships based on the relative stand-alone selling price.
During the Reporting Period, the contract liabilities decreased by approximately US$1,417,000 or 15.1%
to approximately US$7,974,000 (31 December 2022: US$9,391,000), mainly due to more sales revenue
recognised as a result of recognising revenue during the Reporting Period which was included in the
contract liabilities at the beginning of the period.

granted will become vested on the first anniversary of the vesting start date as specified in the option
agreement and (ii) 6.25% of the options granted will become vested as at the end of each three months

The options outstanding at the end of the period/year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of
approximately 7.07 years as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: 7.33 years).
During the Reporting Period, 198,500 options were granted under Post-IPO Share Option Scheme on
21 April 2023 and the total estimated fair value of these options on the date of grant was approximately
US$50,000.
During the year ended 31 December 2022, 237,500 and 140,000 options were granted under Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme on 21 April 2022 and 31 October 2022 respectively and the total estimated fair value
of these options on the date of grant was approximately US$180,000.
Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for each
outstanding option granted under the 2016 Share Option Scheme exercised. Therefore, the weighted
average exercisable price per share under options granted as at 30 June 2023 is US$0.16 (31 December
2022: US$0.16).
During the Reporting Period, the number of exercised options granted under the 2005 Share Option
Scheme and the 2016 Share Option Scheme was 10,000 and 6,200 respectively. The weighted average
closing price of Shares immediately before 28 June 2023 (the exercise date of 10,000 Share options) and 8
February 2023 (the exercise date of 6,200 Share options) was HK$0.49 and HK$0.61 respectively.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (CONTINUED)
Risk-free rates adopted in the valuation model are the yield-to-maturities in continuous compounding of the
Hong Kong Government Bonds with the time-to-maturities similar to that of the options as at the date of
grant.
Where a share option is cancelled or forfeited prior to the expiry date, it is treated as if it had vested on
the date of cancellation or forfeiture, and any expense not yet recognised for the option is recognised
immediately.
The Group recorded total expenses of approximately US$240,000 during the Reporting Period (Prior
Period: US$515,000) in respect of the share option schemes.
Note: The calculation results of the values of the share options are subject to a number of assumptions of the
parameters used herein and the limitation of the model adopted. Therefore, the estimated values of the
share options may be subjective and uncertain.

During the six months ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022 respectively, the accounting policy adopted
for the share options are as follow:
The Group issues share options to certain directors and employees.
Share options granted to directors and employees are measured at the fair value (excluding the effect
of non-market-based vesting conditions) of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the share options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions.
