LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Shareholders,
We are pleased to present to you the 2024 YesAsia Holdings Annual Report highlighting the Company’s first-year
successful implementation of the global expansion strategy. The fast business growth was contributed by both
the YesStyle business-to-consumer (“B2C”) business, and also the AsianBeautyWholesale business-to-business
(“B2B”) business.

REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY
We are delighted to announce that in 2024, YesAsia Holdings achieved record high annual consolidated revenue
of approximately US$345,782,000, representing remarkable growth of approximately 71.7% compared to the Prior
Year’s revenue of approximately US$201,339,000. It is also worth noting that the revenue growth in 2024 has
accelerated from the 56.6% growth in 2023, which validated the success of our expansion strategy. Furthermore,
the Group generated profit of approximately US$19,042,000 in 2024, which was an increase of approximately
151.5% of the profit we made in 2023. The net profit margin improves from approximately 3.8% in 2023 to
approximately 5.5% in 2024.

THE START OF THE GLOBAL EXPANSION STRATEGY
Following the successful turnaround of the business and profitability in 2023, the Group has focused on
implementing a new global expansion strategy in 2024. We leverage the partnership we have developed with
many Korean beauty brands over the past 10 years to assist our business to expand into different countries and
regions in the world. Our Group is the authorized distributor of over 400 Korean cosmetics companies and the
authorization covers many countries and regions in the world.
The English-speaking countries of US, UK, Canada and Australia (“Core Market”) have, for the most part
throughout the 27 years of our Company’s history, contributed the majority of our revenue. In 2024, recognizing
the rising popularity of K-Beauty in many other parts of the world, the Group has deployed more resources to
penetrate the “Non-Core Market”, defined as all countries excluding US, UK, Canada and Australia. As a result, the
revenue of “Non-Core Market” grew by approximately 117.0% in 2024, while the weighting of revenue of “Non-Core
Market” has increased from approximately 39.7% of our Group’s total revenue in 2023 to approximately 50.2% in
2024.
YesStyle, our flagship E-commerce platform offers 5 European languages, namely, French, German, Italian,
Spanish and Dutch. Together with effective influencer and social media marketing, YesStyle Platforms enabled the
Group to increase its EU revenue growth by approximately 91.3% in 2024.
The Spanish language offered by YesStyle Platforms also enabled our penetration into many Latin American
countries with Spanish Language as their official language – in 2024, the Group experienced an outstanding
revenue growth of approximately 536.1% in Latin America.
In August 2024, YesStyle Platforms also launched the Arabic language support. The new language support fueled
the Middle East market, which experienced a revenue growth of approximately 178.0% in 2024.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE GLOBAL K-BEAUTY B2B MARKET
We started the ABW in 2017 to cater for global business customers looking to source beauty products from
Asia. Riding on the soaring demand for K-Beauty products in the markets we serve, ABW has been experiencing
extraordinary growth since 2023. On top of approximately 234.4% of revenue growth in 2023, ABW achieved
another year of fast revenue growth of approximately 100.2% in 2024, bringing in approximately US$77,670,000
revenue.
We set up a warehouse in US near Los Angeles in May 2023 to provide better logistics support to our US B2B
customers. Since then, we have been increasing the warehouse inventory and scheduling monthly South KoreanUS ocean shipments to serve the growing demand in the US. Similarly, in 2024, we have setup two additional
warehouses, one in UK and the other in Germany, to assist our B2B business expansion in UK and Europe.
ABW has provided Asian beauty products and B2B support to over 5,800 business customers in 2024, many of
whom are small to medium sized businesses. ABW also set up a new corporate sales team in November 2024
and, in January 2025, appointed a new Chief Executive Officer of ABW with extensive global B2B experience. We
believe that our recent ABW team expansion shall enable us to extend our B2B support and services to larger
corporate customers. For example, ABW recently entered into a strategic partnership with Kiokii Inc., a leading Asian
beauty retain chain in Canada with 12 stores. ABW aims to forge new partnership with more retail chains across
many of our overseas markets this year.

LOGISTICS UPDATE
We have continued to invest in our warehouse automation and fulfilment capability to further reduce fulfilment
labour costs and improve order fulfilment performance. Our existing AMR warehouse in Goodman Interlink, Tsing
Yi, has saved approximately US$6,593,000 in labour cost in 2024 which was attributable to the deployment of its
161 AMR. Total number of shipments also increased by an impressive approximate of 1.5 times in 2024 compared
with the pre-AMR period of year 2022.
In order to support the anticipated increase in customer orders in the coming few years, the Group is setting up
a second AMR warehouse in Mapletree Logistics Hub, Tsing Yi. More sizable than the first one, the second AMR
warehouse is expected to be equipped with 240 AMRs. Its launch, scheduled for April 2025, shall double our
fulfilment capacity.

DIVIDEND
The Board recommended the declaration of a final dividend payment of HK7.5 cents per Share to all Shareholders.

AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS
Our leadership in e-commerce, and the soundness of our business are well recognized by the business
community. In 2024, YesAsia Holdings was selected as one of the constituents of the MSCI Hong Kong Micro Cap
Index, which is under the MSCI Global Cap Indexes. Assessments for the index are based on key factors, including
minimum market capitalization, free float and liquidity, foreign inclusion factor requirement, and minimum length of
trading requirement.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

YesAsia Holdings Limited was also recognised by the 2024 Corporate Innovation Index (CII), a project by the AsiaPacific Institute of Business (APIB) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong to recognize the achievements of Hong
Kong enterprises in innovation leadership, business performance and business model enhancement. It also won
the Cross-border Corporate – Outstanding Award at the 2024 Standard Chartered Corporate Achievement Award.

OUTLOOK
Looking forward, the era of global expansion for K-Beauty products will still be going strong for both Core and
Non-Core Markets. The market value of K-Beauty products is expected to grow from US$13.59 billion in 2024 to
US$25.98 billion in 2032.
To accelerate our expansion in Europe, which is home to over 40 countries, the Group has recently setup a new
Berlin office to recruit marketing talents with European language capabilities. We believe that K-Beauty popularity
has just started in many countries in Europe and we expect mainland Europe, as a region, will surpass US as the
largest revenue source for the Company in 2025. YesStyle is well positioned to capitalize on the continuing growth
when K-Beauty goes mainstream in Europe in the coming years.
YesStyle has recently launched a Spanish language Instagram account which attracted plenty of followers within
a short period of time. We have also recruited Spanish-speaking content creators in Seoul to further promote
K-Beauty brands, products, and skincare routines to the audience in Spain, as well as over 19 Spanish speaking
countries and territories in Latin America.
We are confident that YesAsia Holdings will reach new heights in the coming year, even as global businesses
brace themselves for increasing uncertainty in geopolitics and global trade relations. Our reliance on US revenue
has also been reduced from approximately 43.5% in 2023 to approximately 33.7% in 2024 as we are expanding
our business to many other countries and regions in the world. We will continue with this revenue diversification
strategy in years to come.
Furthermore, we will deploy more resources to focus on the development of the B2B business. The success of the
B2B expansion will help our company to tap into the growth of the offline retail market, which is several times the
size of the online market. At the same time, the growth of our B2B business allows us to increase our purchase
volume from suppliers and therefore helps to improve both our supply price and business margin.
In conclusion, we are proud to share YesAsia Holdings’ outstanding accomplishments in 2024. We are ready to
devote more resources to expanding our beauty focus strategy that was launched in early 2023. Determined to
consolidate our B2C leadership and enhance our B2B business capabilities, we are confident in sustaining our
growth and profitability as K-Beauty grows mainstream in more and more countries and regions in the world.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS

We would like to express our gratitude to our shareholders for their continuous support of YesAsia Holdings and
belief in our business expansion strategy. We would also like to extend our appreciation to our dedicated team
members whose teamwork and innovation have been instrumental in overcoming numerous challenges, and
capitalizing the promising market opportunities we are seeing.
Thank you once again for your trust and confidence in YesAsia Holdings.
Lastly, we would like to share a quote from Tao Te Ching, in Chapter 64, which emphasizes the importance of
strategy and planning in developing and expanding our business:
“It is easy to sustain when there is good order and structure;
It is easy to contemplate when the issue is yet to arise;
Deal with the thing while it is still nothing;
Keep things in order before disorder sets in.

Rises from a pile of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles
Starts from beneath one’s feet.”
“其安易持，其未兆易謀。為之於未有，治之於未亂。九層之台，起於累土；千里之行，始於足下。”
We hope 2025 brings good health, happiness and many blessings to you and your families.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The robust growth momentum of the Group continued well into 2024, during which its revenue reached another
historical high. Revenue increased across all regions for both retail and wholesale business, with Europe overtaking
the US as the major revenue growth driver.
During the Reporting Year:
–

Revenue increased by about 71.7% to approximately US$345,782,000 (2023: US$201,339,000).

–

Retail revenue from YesStyle and other platforms grew 67.4% to approximately US$265,635,000 (2023:
US$158,655,000), while wholesale revenue rose 100.2% to approximately US$77,670,000 (2023:
US$38,788,000). AsianBeautyWholesale, on the other hand, contributed to 22.5% of the Group’s revenue
in 2024 (2023: 19.3%).

–

Net profit jumped 1.5 times to approximately US$19,042,000 (2023: US$7,572,000) when net profit margin
reached 5.5% (2023: 3.8%).

Market diversification: Non-Core Market becoming the main revenue source
–

Non-Core Market, defined as countries and regions except for the Core Market encompassing US, UK,
Australia and Canada, made up approximately 50.2% of revenue in 2024, compared with approximately
39.7% in 2023.

–

The growth of revenue from Non-Core Market has also been consistently outpacing the revenue growth of
Core Market since 2023 (2024: approximately 117.0% (Non-Core Market) vs approximately 41.9% (Core
Market), 2023: approximately 104.8% (Non-Core Market) vs approximately 35.6% (Core Market)).

–

Amid across-the-board revenue growth, the distribution of revenue by market has changed. US, which has
traditionally made up over half of the revenue, only accounted for approximately 33.7% (2023: 43.5%) of the
Group’s revenue in 2024, despite recording double-digit growth.

–

Non-Core Market made up approximately 50.2% (2023: 39.7%) of the revenue in 2024 with Europe taking
the lead; France and Germany contributed to 9.9% (2023: 8.5%) and 6.0% (2023: 6.3%) of the Group’s
revenue respectively.

–

About 6.3% (2023: 4.2%) and 3.7% (2023: 1.1%) of the Group’s 2024 revenue came from Middle East and
Latin America respectively.

–

Non-Core Market, especially Europe, will become increasingly prominent in the Group’s portfolio, whereas
US will still play an important role.

Expansion in local and overseas logistic network
We have broadened our logistics network in Hong Kong, US, and Europe to provide faster and more competitively
priced delivery worldwide, while strengthening our supply chain agility in face of changing international trade
landscape.

ii)

Hong Kong: a second autonomous mobile robotics (AMR) warehouse
•

The Group has invested in a second AMR warehouse to enlarge the scope of its smart warehouse
solutions, which enable it to quickly, accurately satisfy any spike in shipment volume without incurring
significant costs.

•

The Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse, is set for commencement of operation in around April
2025. Boasting 147,468 sq. ft. in gross floor area with 240 AMRs, it will replace the existing AMR
warehouse (137,525 sq. ft.) as the largest AMR warehouse in Hong Kong.

•

The existing AMR warehouse in Goodman Interlink, Tsing Yi, is expected to achieved return on
automation investment within three years since its launch in 2022 October, earlier than the original
schedule. In 2024, it achieved approximately US$6,593,000 (2023: US$3,374,000) in labour cost
saving. Its 161 AMRs managed over 10,000 shipments daily, achieving an impressive increase of
approximately 1.5 times in total number of shipments compared to the pre-AMR year of 2022.

Overseas warehouses in UK, Germany, and US
•

In 2024 May, we set up a warehouse in Hahn, Germany, and in Sheffield, UK to offer speedy delivery
service (1-3 days in UK; 1-7 days in EU) at a more competitive price.

•

Like the Group’s warehouse in California, US, the two new warehouses work in partnership with
vendors, and are responsible for inventory management, order pick and pack, and fulfilment.

•

The California warehouse provided direct shipment of 70 brands from South Korea to US in 2024.

B2B Business Expansion: AsianBeautyWholesale (ABW)

The Group has set up a corporate sales team to facilitate wholesale orders, which are multiple times bigger
than retail orders.

–

Revenue from ABW grew to approximately US$77,670,000 (2023: US$38,788,000), contributing
approximately 22.5% (2023: 19.3%) of the Group’s total revenue.

–

ABW’s number of customers, number of orders and average order size rose by approximately 4.3%, 48.5%
and 32.7% respectively as compared to the Prior Year.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Social media marketing and AI-powered customer journey
The continued global boom in K-beauty market is driven by digital savvy, young customers who have a penchant
for online marketplace, social-media platforms, and unique experiences. We were the first in the market to heavily
invest in its social media marketing and AI technologies, which have contributed to our exponential growth over the
past few years. For example, our aggressive YesStyle Influencer Program, which boasted approximately 403,000
(2023: 333,000) unique influencers in 2024, guaranteed both audiences reach and a steady stream of unique
content.
Here is an overview of our social media and digital initiatives:
i)

18

KOLs, and YesStyle Influencer Program
•

During the Reporting Year, revenue generated from influencer referrals increased to approximately
US$73,287,000 (2023: US$40,422,000), amounting to approximately 27.6% of the YesStyle
Platforms’ revenue (2023: 25.5%).

•

The total number of unique influencers under YesStyle Influencer Program grew to approximately
403,000 in 2024 (2023: 333,000), plus approximately 1,500 KOLs.

•

The success of these initiatives also enhanced the presence of YesStyle social media platforms. For
example, as of end of 2024, YesStyle has approximately 1,600,000 Instagram (“IG”) followers and
73,000,000 reel views, up approximately 23.1% and 98.4% respectively compared with 2023.

•

Short-form videos have become increasingly popular. For 2024, the YesStyle marketing team has
produced 360 videos on IG Reels, attracting approximately 73,000,000 views (2023: 318 videos and
36,801,000 views on IG reels).

•

Popularity of YesStyle on TikTok boomed in 2024 with number of followers grew by 93.7% to
approximately 734,000 as at the year end of 2024 (2023: 379,000) and the number of views surged
by approximately 217.2% to approximately 29,887,000 as of 31 December 2024 (2023: 9,422,000).

strategic oversight of brand IG and TikTok influencer accounts during the Reporting Year. YesStyle’s

iii)

YesStyle Key Product Program
•

The Group was able to leverage its extensive logistics network and brand partnerships to dispatch
real products to KOLs and influencers for product seeding.

•

Promotion products enjoyed high visibility via YesStyle homepage (website and app), social media
platforms, and product seeding campaigns among KOLs and influencers.

•

In 2024, YesStyle achieved multi-fold increase in sales for promotion products, especially in mega
sales campaigns that promoted collective buying.

AI-powered customer journey:
•

Powered by AI technology, our customer relationship management (CRM) system enhanced the
relevance of customer journey by collecting and analysing customer data. It has successfully
increased customer retention rate, and revenue from existing customers while reducing operational
costs.

•

Revenue facilitated by the CRM system increased to approximately US$58,351,000 during the
Reporting Year (2023: US$26,023,000), representing an increase of approximately 124.2%.

•

The number of YesStyle loyalty program members grew by approximately 34.2% to approximately
15,585,000 as at end of 2024 (2023: 11,617,000).

members in 2024 (2023: 98,000), where revenue generated went up by approximately 46.6% to
approximately US$7,543,000 (2023: US$5,145,000).

•

There was also a 77.4% growth in active email opener counts, demonstrating the success of AIgenerated electronic direct-marketing content based on data-driven insight.

Cost control
While we are investing into business development, cost control remains crucial to the e-commerce industry as
it grapples with increased uncertainties that bring about both challenges and opportunities. As we develop our
business agility and strength, we have been able to keep our expenses growth in line with our revenue growth:
–

Our selling expenses, excluding payment gateway charges, amounted to approximately US$33,341,000
for 2024 (2023: US$18,719,000), representing an increase of approximately 78.1%, which is in line with the
growth rate of the Group’s revenue (approximately 71.7%) during the Reporting Year.

–

Administrative staff costs (excluding directors’ emoluments), on the other hand, rose approximately 34.5%
to approximately US$22,530,000 for 2024 (2023: US$16,755,000), which was due to (i) expansion of
headcount and (ii) bonus provisions amounted to approximately US$4,106,000 (2023: US$1,138,000)
based on the Group’s progressive bonus scheme with results in the Reporting Year far exceeded the
targets set at the beginning of the Reporting Year.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

PROSPECTS
We believe we are strategically positioned to navigate geopolitical complexities, and to continue to lead in both
retail and wholesale sectors of the K-beauty e-commerce market around the world. For the way forward, we are
going to align our strategies and operations with the following themes that should set the direction of our growth
for the next few years.
Focus on Non-Core market
The international appetite for K-beauty products remains strong. From 2024 to 2032, the market value of K-beauty
products is anticipated to almost double from US$13.59 billion to US$25.98 billion, representing a compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4% during the period.
South Korea continued to be the top country for beauty product imports into the US in 2024, surpassing French
products. Nonetheless, the market size of European market is comparable to that of the US. In addition, the
beauty market growth in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America outperforms that of other regions.
Against this backdrop, we expect the growth in Non-Core Market to continue to outstrip Core Market. We will,
therefore, continue to expand our multi-lingual marketing capabilities and logistic networks in Europe, Middle East
and Latin America.
With the success in running campaigns in 2024, we will launch 9 seasonal campaigns including 3 mega sale, in
2025 to further drive YesStyle growth.
Expansion into global wholesale market
To capitalize on the soaring global demand for Asian beauty products, the Group is expanding into global
wholesale market, aggressively forging partnerships with high-street retail chains to elevate Asian brands in the
offline retail market, which is several times the size of online retail.
To capitalize on the soaring demand for Asian beauty products in North America, ABW has expanded its strategic
course to actively engage with retailers, acknowledging the value of collaborative growth.
i)

Appointment of new ABW CEO
The Group has appointed Howon Song (“Mr. Song”) to become the new Chief Executive Officer of ABW,
effective from 2025 January. With his expertise in K-Beauty industry and global B2B strategy, Mr. Song
set up and lead dedicated teams in South Korea and Hong Kong to forge new partnerships for ABW. He
will also optimize logistical operations, supervise B2B marketing strategies on a global scale, and raise the
profile of K-beauty products among global retailers.

20

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

ii)

Partnership with Canadian beauty chain, Kiokii Inc. (“Kiokii”)
ABW and Kiokii is forging a strategic alliance to elevate the presence of Asian brands in the North American
market. As an ally, ABW will play a vital role in the expansion plan of Kiokii by providing support in marketing
strategies and utilizing big data analytics to help introduce new products to its shops.
Kiokii aims to grow the number of its stores from 12 to 25 by the end of 2025. It also plans to unveil its first
flagship store in 2025 Q3 at American Dream, the second-largest mall in the US, with ABW supplying the
latest seasonal Asian products.
The alliance marks ABW’s first formal entry into the offline retail market in North America. It also signifies a
new era where ABW will leverage the combined global and local, as well as online and offline, expertise with
its partners to expand its global footprints.

Business agility and resilience
Business agility will increasingly become an imperative in light of geopolitics and heightened tension in international
trade relations, which could result in trade intervention policies. It is our strategic priority to build up the strength
and agility of our supply chain.
Through prioritising the expansion of our wholesale business, and committing our resources to enhancing our
logistics capabilities, we will strive to increase the economies of scale, where the increased bulk, volume and
velocity of our shipment shall improve our bargaining power with suppliers.
On the other hand, the highly automated facilities in our Hong Kong warehouses, and our logistic network in US,
UK and Europe will also enable us to make agile arrangements in response to global events. For example, we can
choose to ship in bulk from South Korea to our US warehouse, and fulfil our orders locally to mitigate the impact of
geographical and trade tensions.
Social media and digital marketing
To engage our digital savvy consumers, we will continue to expand our YesStyle Influencer program to provide
appealing content and unique experience with brand products on various social media platforms. To cater for
the global interest in South Korean culture, we plan to set up a studio in Korea in 2025, and recruit overseas
influencers to produce videos on site for their followers.

approximately US$83,000 during the Prior Year to approximately US$1,296,000 during the Reporting Year. The
increase was primarily attributable to the following:
•

approximately US$1,337,000 increase in marketing income for marketing campaigns aimed at promotion of
the brands of K-Beauty products suppliers;

•

approximately US$83,000 or 53.5% increase in interest income from bank deposits;

offset by:
•

the absence of compensation income for early termination of service agreement (2023: approximately
US$219,000).

Selling Expenses
The Group’s selling expenses during the Reporting Year were approximately US$42,121,000 (2023:
US$23,908,000), representing an increase of approximately US$18,213,000 or 76.2% as compared to that for the
Prior Year. Such increase was mainly attributable to the following:
•

approximately US$9,177,000 or 95.6% increase in marketing and promotion fees due to further increase in
beauty products-focused promotion;

•

approximately US$3,713,000 or 121.3% increase in outsourced warehouse labour charges;

•

approximately US$3,591,000 or 69.2% in payment gateway charges which was in line with the revenue
growth;

•

approximately US$948,000 or 174.9% increase in customs duties mainly due to increase in sales in regions
such as Europe and Middle East; and

•

approximately US$525,000 or 13.3% increase in warehouse wages.

With the increase in revenue and sales order volume during the Reporting Year, warehouse wages and outsourced
warehouse labour charges (collectively “warehouse labour cost”) in aggregate increased by approximately
60.4% as compared to the Prior Year. Nonetheless, warehouse labour cost as a percentage of revenue for the
Reporting Year was approximately 3.3% (2023: 3.5%), reflecting continuous improvement in efficiency in our
fulfillment process.

US$29,577,000), representing an increase by approximately US$10,184,000 or 34.4% as compared to that of
2023. Such increase was mainly attributable to the following:
•

approximately US$5,775,000 or 34.5% increase in staff costs as the number of administrative employees
increased from 357 as at 31 December 2023 to 416 as at 31 December 2024 and approximately
US$4,106,000 of bonuses accrued (2023: US$1,138,000);

•

approximately US$1,017,000 or 66.7% increase in net exchange losses, due to more payments settled by
our payment gateway as a result of revenue increase during the Reporting Year;

•

approximately US$1,012,000 or 22.0% increase in depreciation of right-of-use assets due to the newly
leased office and warehouse in South Korea and Hong Kong respectively;

•

approximately US$542,000 or 115.3% increase in other administrative expenses which was mainly driven
by the renovations and upgrades to the air-conditioning systems in Hong Kong warehouses, elevated stock
transportation costs between Hong Kong warehouses, additional interoffice travel expenses resulting from
the establishment of new overseas offices, and fees associated with outsourced payroll services during the
Reporting Year;

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

•

US$539,000 or 71.9% increase in directors’ remuneration during the Reporting Year mainly due to
approximately US$514,000 increase in bonuses accrued during the Reporting Year;

•

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Finance Costs
The Group’s finance costs for the Reporting Year were approximately US$1,300,000 (2023: US$1,218,000),
representing an increase of approximately 6.7% as compared to that of the Prior Year, reflecting an increase in
interest for bank borrowings for the Reporting Year.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense for the Reporting Year was approximately US$4,458,000 (2023: US$510,000). The income
tax expense during the Reporting Year was mainly due to increase in operating profit generated as compared to
that of the Prior Year and reduction in tax losses available for the Reporting Year.
Profit for the Year
As a result of the foregoing, the Group recorded a net profit of approximately US$19,042,000 for the Reporting
Year, as compared with approximately US$7,572,000 during the Prior Year, represented an increase of
approximately US$11,470,000 or 151.5%. The increase in net profit was mainly attributable to (i) an enhancement
of YesStyle Platforms’ marketing efforts to promote the sale of beauty products, and (ii) the expansion of
AsianBeautyWholesale to serve more business-to-business (B2B) customers globally who are looking to source
Asian beauty products.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
During the Reporting Year, the Group acquired plant and equipment of approximately US$323,000 (2023:
US$754,000). The capital expenditure during the Reporting Year was mainly attributable to purchase of new
equipments for Hong Kong warehouses, computer hardware and software during the Reporting Year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of 31 December 2024, the Group’s bank and cash balances amounted to approximately US$15,529,000 (2023:
US$25,181,000), which were mainly denominated in US Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, South Korean Won, Japanese
Yen, British Pound Sterling and Euro.
As at 31 December 2024, the Group’s bank and cash balances comprises (i) cash and cash equivalents of
approximately US$15,448,000 (2023: US$25,088,000); and (ii) bank fixed deposits with original maturity beyond
three months of approximately US$81,000 (2023: US$93,000).
Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately US$9,640,000 during the Reporting Year, which
was attributable to the net cash generated from operating activities of approximately US$1,949,000, offset by
the net cash used in (i) investing activities of approximately US$3,099,000; (ii) financing activities of approximately
US$7,511,000; and (iii) the negative effect of foreign exchange rate changes of approximately US$979,000 during
the year ended 31 December 2024.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

27

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended 31 December 2024 was mainly due to
(i) approximately US$9,891,000 increase in trade and other payables and accruals; and (ii) approximately
US$3,527,000 increase in contract liabilities, offset by (i) operating profit before working capital changes of
approximately US$32,652,000; (ii) approximately US$34,417,000 increase in inventories; (iii) approximately
US$4,114,000 increase in trade and other receivables; (iv) approximately US$3,159,000 increase in prepayments
and deposits; (v) approximately US$1,196,000 income taxes paid; (vi) approximately US$1,091,000 interest paid
for lease liabilities; (vii) approximately US$119,000 interest on bank borrowings; and (viii) approximately US$25,000
decrease in provisions.
The expansion in inventory level was in line with our development of B2B business and the setting up regional
warehouse in the US and Europe.
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended 31 December 2024 was mainly due to (i) approximately
US$2,933,000 increase in deposit paid for property plant and equipment for setting up of Mapletree Smart
Robotics Warehouse; (ii) approximately US$290,000 property, plant and equipment purchased during the
Reporting Year which mainly included leasehold improvements and new equipment for the current AMR
warehouse; and (iii) approximately US$100,000 deposit paid for investment in an associate, partially offset by (i)
approximately US$212,000 interest received; and (ii) approximately US$12,000 decrease in non-pledged bank
fixed deposits.
Net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to (i) approximately US$9,300,000 borrowings raised; and
(ii) approximately US$2,026,000 of proceeds from issuance of shares during the Reporting Year, offset by (i)
approximately US$9,300,000 of borrowings repaid; (ii) approximately US$5,452,000 repayment of principal
elements of lease payments; (iii) approximately US$2,411,000 dividend paid; and (iv) approximately US$1,674,000
increase in pledged bank fixed deposits during the Reporting Year.
Our bank fixed deposits with original maturity beyond three months decreased by US$12,000 during the Reporting
Year as compared to that in the Prior Year, to increase liquidity in supporting the Group’s operation during the
Reporting Year.
As at 31 December 2024, the Group had no bank borrowings outstanding (2023: Nil). The unutilised banking
facilities as at 31 December 2024 amounted to approximately US$24,288,000 (2023: US$6,648,000).
We believe that our liquidity requirements and our expected source of funding in the coming year will be satisfied
by using the cash generated from our operations and banking facilities available.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

TREASURY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICIES
The Group’s treasury management policy is to avoid any investment in highly-leveraged or speculative derivative
products. The Group continued to be conservative in managing financial risk during the Reporting Year. Consistent
with the aforesaid treasury objectives and policy, the Group undertakes treasury management activities with
respect to its surplus cash assets. The selection criteria of investments include the relative risk profile involved, the
liquidity of an investment, the after-tax-equivalent yield of an investment and investments that are not speculative in
nature.
Most business transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group were denominated either in US Dollar, Hong
Kong Dollar, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling and Euro. The E-commerce customers
of the Group generally settle their invoices using their designated currencies upon checkout via secure payment
gateways, and the fund is generally transferred to the Group’s account in Hong Kong Dollar and US Dollar upon
currency conversion. As Hong Kong Dollar is pegged to US Dollar, our Group does not expect any significant
movements in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars. Besides, our Group has certain
exposure to foreign currency risk as some of our business transactions, assets and liabilities are denominated in
currencies (i.e. South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, British Pound Sterling, Renminbi and Euro, etc) other than the
functional currency of our Group (i.e. US Dollar).
Currently, we do not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy. However, our management monitors foreign
exchange exposure constantly and will consider to engage in derivatives markets or foreign exchange hedging
measures to minimize the foreign exchange risk when it is foreseen to be significant.

GEARING RATIO
Our gearing ratio, calculated by total interest-bearing liabilities (including lease liabilities) divided by total equity,
increased from approximately 34.8% as at 31 December 2023 to approximately 43.0% as at 31 December 2024,
primarily due to the increase in lease liabilities for the Mapletree Smart Robotics Warehouse, which is set for
operation in around April 2025.

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
Save for those disclosed in note 37 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group did not have any significant
capital commitments as at 31 December 2024.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HELD
During the Reporting Year, we did not hold any significant investments, save for the 1,100,000 shares in CN
Logistics, representing approximately 0.37% of the issued share capital of CN Logistics with a fair value amounted
to approximately US$489,000 as at 31 December 2024 (2023: US$863,000). The investment represents
approximately 0.4% of the total consolidated asset of the Group as at 31 December 2024 (2023: 1.2%). The
aforementioned 1,100,000 shares in CN Logistics were subscribed by the Company at a total cash consideration
of HK$10,120,000. The principal activity of CN Logistics is investment holding, and through its subsidiaries,
principally engages in the provision of air freight forwarding services and distribution and logistics services in
relation to fashion products and fine wine, primarily focusing on high-end fashion (including luxury and affordable
luxury) products. CN Logistics is a strategic logistics partner of the Group for delivery of our customers’ products
to the US, Europe and other overseas markets.
As at 31 December 2024, the unrealised fair value loss of such investment was approximately US$374,000 due to
the decrease in share price in CN Logistics during the Reporting Year from the carrying value as at 31 December
2023. We have received dividend of approximately US$4,000 from the investment during the Reporting Year.
In view of the expected complementary effect and positive impact to the business of both CN Logistics and the
Group through the strategic logistics partnership, the investment in CN Logistics is expected to be strategic and
enable the Group to foster a closer business partnership with CN Logistics for a longer term and result in potential
investment returns to the Shareholders.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is overall responsible for evaluating and determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to
take in achieving the Group’s strategic objectives, and ensures that the Group has established and maintained
appropriate and effective risk management and internal control systems. A sound risk management and internal
control system aims to reduce the risks faced by the Group in the process of achieving various business goals and
to provide reasonable but not absolute guarantees for the realization of business goals.
The Audit Committee reviews the risk management and internal controls that are significant to the Group on an
on-going basis. The Audit Committee would consider the adequacy of resources, qualifications, experience and
training of staff and external advisors of the Group’s accounting and financial reporting departments. The Company
convened meetings with the Audit Committee periodically to discuss financial, operational and compliance controls
and risk management functions. Moreover, the Audit Committee assists the Board in leading the management and
overseeing their design, implementation and monitoring of the risk management and internal control systems.
The management of the Group is responsible for designing, maintaining, implementing and monitoring the risk
management and internal control systems to ensure adequate control is in place to safeguard the Group’s assets
and stakeholder’s interest. Management also assists the Board in the implementation of the Group’s policies,
procedures and controls by identifying and assessing the risks faced, and in the design, operation and monitoring
of suitable internal controls to mitigate and control these risks.
Our Board has established the risk and compliance committee (“Risk and Compliance Committee”), which
comprises Mr. Lau, Ms. Chu and Mr. Chu, all of whom are executive Directors. The Risk and Compliance
Committee oversees our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance, management approach and
strategy. The Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for establishing, adopting, and reviewing our ESG
policies, and evaluates ESG-related risks (including risks to the Group’s businesses) on an annual basis.
The Group has formulated the internal control manual of the Group to govern the policies and procedures of the
Group’s risk management and internal control. Furthermore, the Group periodically reviewed the Company’s
policies and procedures, code of business conduct, corruption and conflicts of interest policy and whistleblowing
policy. The Board would perform annual review on any significant change of business environment and
establish procedures to respond to the risks resulting from significant change of business environment. The risk
management and internal control systems are designed to mitigate the potential losses and adverse impact to our
business and protect the Shareholders’ interests.

52

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The management would identify the risks associated with the business of the Group by considering both internal
and external factors and events which include politics, economy, technology, environmental, social and staff. Each
of the risks has been assessed and prioritised based on their relevant impact and chance of occurrence. The
relevant risk management strategies would be applied to each type of risks according to the assessment results.
Types of risk management strategies are listed as follow:
–

Risk retention and reduction: accept the impact of risk or undertake actions by the Group to reduce the
impact of the risk;

–

Risk avoidance: change business process or objective so as to avoid risk;

–

Risk sharing and diversification: diversify the effect of risk or allocate to different locations or products or
markets;

–

Risk transfer: transfer ownership and liability to a third party.

The internal control systems are designed and implemented to reduce the risks associated with the business
accepted by the Group and minimize the adverse impact resulting from the risks. The risk management and
internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
BT Corporate Governance Limited (“BTCGL”) has been appointed to review the effectiveness of the internal control
systems of the Group, including financial, operational and compliance risks and the respective risk mitigation
activities, during the Reporting Year.
BTCGL has prepared the internal audit report and presented to the Group’s management and operational teams
for their attention and appropriate actions. Remedial actions have been developed collaboratively by the Group’s
management and operational teams to rectify the control weaknesses identified.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Group does not have an internal audit function and the Board is of the view that there is no immediate need to
set up an internal audit function within the Group having reviewed the size, nature and complexity of the Group’s
business during the Reporting Year. It was decided that the Board would be directly responsible for internal control
of the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Procedures have been designed for safeguarding assets against
unauthorised use or disposition, ensuring the maintenance of proper accounting records for the provision of
reliable financial information for internal use or for publication, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws, rules
and regulations. The situation will be reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.
The risk management and internal control systems are reviewed annually. During the Reporting Year, the Board
completed the review of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and concluded them to be
effective and adequate. The Board and management also reviewed the adequacy of the resources, qualifications,
and experience of the staff in the accounting and financial reporting functions of the Group, as well as the
adequacy of the training courses and related budgets received by the staff and were satisfied with the results.

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY
The Group has adopted arrangements to facilitate employees and other stakeholders to raise concerns, in
confidence, about possible improprieties in financial reporting, internal control or other matters.
The Audit Committee shall review such arrangements regularly and ensure that proper arrangements are in place
for fair and independent investigation of these matters and for appropriate follow-up action.

guidelines, including the obligations to disclose inside information under the SFO and the Listing Rules, and the

the handling and dissemination procedures in relation to inside information, and has communicated to all relevant
personnel and provided them with specific training in respect of the implementation of the continuous disclosure
policy.

less exacting than the required standard as set out in the Model Code.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The E-commerce industry is highly competitive and the Group may not compete successfully against new and
existing competitors, which may materially and adversely affect the Group’s financial conditions and results of
operations
The E-commerce industry is subject to intense competition, which is particularly true with respect to the Group’s
core business, being the online retail of fashion & lifestyle, beauty and entertainment products. The Group faces a
variety of competitive challenges, including:
•

sourcing products efficiently and economically;

•

identifying new and emerging brands and maintaining relationships with those brands or their business
partners;

•

competing for and retaining high quality suppliers;

•

pricing of products competitively;

•

facilitate efficient and economic warehousing, fulfillment and delivery arrangement;

•

maintaining the quality of services;

•

anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer demands and preferences;

•

developing new features to enhance the customer experience on the Group’s platforms;

•

international markets expansion;

•

acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers;

•

conducting effective marketing activities and maintaining favorable recognition of the Group’s brands,
websites and products; and

•

navigating the rapidly evolving IT system.

If the Group cannot properly address these challenges, the Group’s business and prospects would be materially
and adversely affected. In addition, factors beyond the Group’s control such as imposition of or increase in taxes
or tariffs, fluctuations of exchange rates or general economic downturns could also lower the Group’s profitability
under the competition pressure.
As a mitigating measure, the Group continues to launch new marketing initiatives to recruit new members and
enhance the shopping experience for customers and loyalty by deployment of a new customer relationship
management system. With the use of data analytics, the Group can provide more customized content that helps
the Group to expand customers base.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

The Group uses third-party couriers to deliver orders. If these couriers fail to provide reliable delivery services at
commercially acceptable terms, the Group’s business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.
The Group delivers goods through major local and international courier companies. Interruptions to or failures in
these third parties’ delivery services could inhibit the timely or proper delivery of the goods to customers. Service
rates with these third party service providers may fluctuate. If these third-party couriers fail to deliver the goods
in time or at all, or at uncompetitive costs, the Group may not be able to find alternative delivery companies to
provide delivery services in a timely and cost efficient manner, or at all. If the goods are not delivered in proper
condition or on a timely basis to our customers under a reasonable cost, the Group’s business, prospects or
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
As a mitigating measure, on 29 November 2021, the Group entered into a memorandum of understanding with
CN Logistics, pursuant to which CN Logistics would offer logistics services for the Group’s delivery of products
in the United States and Europe and other overseas markets at charging rates which are expected to be at least
10% lower than the best available quotation by other independent service providers received and maintained by
the Group on a regular basis. The Group believes the cooperation would enable the Group to offer more shipping
options to customers and to attract more traffic to the online platforms maintained by the Group.
The financial risk factors are set out in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Key Relationships with Employees, Customers and Suppliers
The Group has always paid great attention to and maintained a good business relationship with its suppliers of
products and services, and has been providing, quality professional and customer-oriented services for its regional
markets and customers. Suppliers and customers are good business partners creating value for the Group.
The Group also values the knowledge and skills of its employees, and continues to provide favourable career
development opportunities for its employees.

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE
The Group is committed to the environmental protection principle for delivering sustainable value to our
stakeholders and have set out various initiatives aiming at the control of paper waste during our operations. The
Group has not noted any material non-compliance with the relevant laws and regulations in relation to its business
covering health and safety, workplace conditions, employment and the environment aspects during the Reporting
Year. The Group has established its environmental, social and governance policies which set forth environmental
protection measures, social responsibility principles and internal governance policies, and the Board has reviewed
and confirmed its satisfaction with the implementation effectiveness and performance of such policies during
the Reporting Year. The environmental, social and governance report of the Company for the year ended 31
December 2024 is available on the Company’s website at https://www.yesasiaholdings.com and the Hong Kong
Exchanges and Clearing Limited’s website at https://www.hkexnews.hk. Going forward, the Group will review
its environmental practices from time to time and will consider implementing further eco-friendly measures and
practices in the Group’s daily operation and continue to promote environmental practices and social sustainability.
The Company acknowledges the significant contributions by its stakeholders (including our employees, customers,
suppliers, Shareholders and the communities) for progressing towards a sustainable development, and values
their feedbacks and opinions to guide our management strategy on pertinent sustainability matters. To ensure
transparent communication with our stakeholders, the Company has implemented whistleblowing channels as an
integral part of its corporate governance and stakeholder engagement framework. Furthermore, the Company has
established various communication channels to facilitate effective engagement with diverse stakeholders and gain
insight into their expectations regarding the Company’s long-term growth trajectory.

The Company adopted a share option scheme on 30 June 2016 (“2016 Share Option Scheme”) for the purpose
of enabling the Company to attract and retain qualified employees of providing them with an opportunity for

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

Post-IPO Share Option Scheme
A post-IPO share option scheme was adopted by the Company on 13 March 2021, which was conditional upon
the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange and came into effect on 9 July 2021 (the “Post-IPO Share
Option Scheme”). The Post-IPO Share Option Scheme shall be valid and effective for the period of ten years
from the date of the listing of the Shares on the Stock Exchange until 8 July 2031. The purpose of the Post-IPO
Share Option Scheme is to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company
to attract and retain qualified employees or directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries through providing
them with an opportunity for investment in the shares of the Company. Participants to the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme include any individual, being an employee or director of the Company and/or the Company’s subsidiaries
who the Board or its delegate(s) considers, in their sole discretion, to have contributed or will contribute to
the business performance of the Group. However, no individual who is a resident in a place where the grant,
acceptance or exercise of options pursuant to the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is not permitted under the laws
and regulations of such place or where, in the view of the Board or its delegate(s), compliance with applicable laws
and regulations in such place makes it necessary or expedient to exclude such individual from the grant or offer of
such options.
The total number of Shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options that could be granted under
the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme is 39,539,079, being 10% of the Shares in issue on the date the Shares
commence trading on the Stock Exchange (the “Option Scheme Mandate Limit”) (excluding any Shares which
may be issued pursuant to the exercise of the outstanding options granted under the Pre-IPO Share Option
Schemes). Options which have lapsed in accordance with the terms of the rules of the Post-IPO Share Option
Scheme (or any other share option schemes of the Company) shall not be counted for the purpose of calculating
the Option Scheme Mandate Limit.
Unless approved by the Shareholders, the total number of Shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of
the options granted and to be granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme and any other share option
scheme(s) of the Company to each selected participant (including both exercised and outstanding options) in
any 12-month period shall not exceed 1% of the total number of Shares in issue (the “Individual Limit”). Any
further grant of options to a selected participant which would result in the aggregate number of Shares issued
and to be issued upon exercise of all options granted and to be granted to such selected participant (including
exercised, canceled and outstanding options) in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such
further grant exceeding the Individual Limit shall be subject to separate approval of the Shareholders (with such
selected participant and his close associates abstaining from voting). There was no option granted under such
circumstances during the Reporting Year.
Following the Share Split which took effect on 9 June 2021, each grantee shall receive 10 Shares for exercising
each outstanding option granted under the Post-IPO Share Option Scheme.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

The subscription price, being the amount payable for each Share to be subscribed for under an option, in the
event of the option being exercised shall be determined by the Board but shall be not less than the greater of:
(i)

the closing price of a Share as stated in the daily quotations sheet issued by the Stock Exchange on the
date of grant;

(ii)

the average closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets issued by the Stock
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and

(iii)

the nominal value of a Share on the date of grant.

An option is personal to the grantee and shall not be transferable or assignable and no grantee shall in any way
sell, transfer, charge, mortgage, encumber or otherwise dispose of or create any interest in favor of or enter into
any agreement with any other person over or in relation to any option.
Each grant of options to any director, chief executive or substantial shareholder of the Company (or any of
their respective associates) must first be approved by the independent non-executive Directors (excluding any
independent non-executive Director who is a proposed recipient of the grant of options).
In addition, where any grant of options to a substantial shareholder or an independent non-executive Director
of the Company (or any of their respective associates) would result in the number of Shares issued and to be
issued upon exercise of all options already granted and to be granted (including options exercised, canceled and
outstanding) to such person in the 12-month period up to and including the date of such grant:
(i)

representing in aggregate over 0.1% (or such other higher percentage as may from time to time be specified
by the Stock Exchange) of the Shares in issue; and

(ii)

having an aggregate value, based on the closing price of the Shares as stated in the daily quotations sheets
issued by the Stock Exchange on the date of grant, in excess of HK$5,000,000 (or such other higher
amount as may from time to time be specified by the Stock Exchange),

such further grant of options must also be first approved by the Shareholders (voting by way of poll) in a general
meeting. In obtaining the approval, the Company shall send a circular to the Shareholders in accordance with and
containing such information as is required under the Listing Rules. All core connected persons of the Company
shall abstain from voting at such general meeting, except that any core connected person may vote against the
relevant resolution at the general meeting provided that his intention to do so has been stated in the circular to be
sent to the Shareholders in connection therewith. There was no option granted under such circumstances during
the Reporting Year.

TO THE MEMBERS OF
YESASIA HOLDINGS LIMITED
(Incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability)

OPINION
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of YesAsia Holdings Limited (the “Company”) and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”) set out on pages 86 to 160, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial
position as at 31 December 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, the consolidated statement
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including
material accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position
of the Group as at 31 December 2024, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued
by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the “HKICPA”) and have been properly prepared in
compliance with the Companies Ordinance.

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (“HKSAs”) issued by the HKICPA.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with
the HKICPA’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the “Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matter we identified is:
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition of revenue generated from selfoperated online platform

Our procedures in relation to the recognition of
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
included:

We identified recognition of revenue generated from
self-operated online platform as a key audit matter
as the relevant sales transactions were conducted
through the Group’s self-operated online platform from
receiving the sales orders to arranging the delivery
and the total revenue amount and volume involved
are significant. The recognition of such revenue is
highly dependent on data flow accuracy of and the
IT controls over the online platform. Hence, it gives
rise to an inherent risk that such revenue could be
misstated or subject to manipulation.
The Group’s revenue generated from self-operated
online platform is recognised when the ordered
goods are delivered or picked up, being the time
when customers obtain control over the goods. The
accounting policy for revenue recognition and related
performance obligations are disclosed in Note 4(m)
and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements,
respectively. For the year ended 31 December 2024,
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
amounted to US$344,114,000, represented 99.5% of
the Group’s total revenue, which is set out in Note 8
to the consolidated financial statements.

•

Obtaining an understanding of and assessing
the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of key internal controls which
govern such revenue recognition;

•

Engaging our internal IT specialists to obtain
an understanding of and assessing the design,
implementation and operating effectiveness of
general IT controls for relevant IT applications
and IT application controls which govern such
revenue recognition;

•

Engaging our internal IT specialists to assist
us in testing the data flow accuracy and
assessing the operating effectiveness of those
IT application controls which are relevant to the
recognition of revenue;

•

Understanding the terms of delivery of the sales
orders and assessing whether the management
of the Group recognised the revenue in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy
and when Group’s performance obligations are
satisfactorily fulfilled;

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Recognition of revenue generated from selfoperated online platform (continued)

Our procedures in relation to the recognition of
revenue generated from self-operated online platform
included: (continued)
•

Checking the supporting documents for
recognition of the revenue including sales
invoices, goods delivery notes and/or evidence
of the customers’ acknowledgement of receipt
of the goods on the self-operated online
platform, on a sample basis;

•

Obtaining audit confirmations to confirm the
sales transaction amounts from customers,
on a sample basis, and performing alternative
procedures for unreturned confirmations; and

•

Performing data analysis to identity unusual
pattern and fluctuation of revenue generated
from self-operated online platform and
obtaining explanation from the management of
the Group together with checking the relevant
supporting documents.

OTHER INFORMATION
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information
included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

82

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair
view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the Companies Ordinance, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee assists the directors in discharging their responsibilities for overseeing the Group’s financial
reporting process.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 405 of the Companies
Ordinance and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other
person for the contents of this report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

83

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

84

•

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

•

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Group’s internal control.

•

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the directors.

•

Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

•

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

•

Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial
information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit
work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards
applied.
From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
key audit matter. We describe this matter in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Ms. Ng Wai Kwun.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2024

1.

GENERAL INFORMATION
YesAsia Holdings Limited (the “Company”) was incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability. The address
of its registered office and principal place of business is 5/F, KC100, 100 Kwai Cheong Road, Kwai Chung,
New Territories, Hong Kong.
The shares of the Company were listed on Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the
“Stock Exchange”) (the “Listing”) on 9 July 2021 (the “Listing Date”).
The Company is an investment holding company. The principal activities of its subsidiaries are set out in
Note 35 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred
to as the “Group”.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in United State dollars (“US$”) and all values are
rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000), unless otherwise stated.
In the opinion of the directors of the Company, the Company has no ultimate holding company. Mr. Lau
Kwok Chu and Ms. Chu Lai King are the ultimate controlling parties of the Company.

2.

BASIS OF PREPARATION
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong
Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRSs”) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (the “HKICPA”). HKFRSs comprise Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (“HKFRS”);
Hong Kong Accounting Standards (“HKAS”); and Interpretations. These consolidated financial statements
also comply with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the
Stock Exchange (“Listing Rules”) and with the requirements of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622).
The HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early
adoption for the current accounting period of the Group. Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
provides information on any changes in accounting policies resulting from initial application of these
developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods
reflected in these consolidated financial statements.

For the year ended 31 December 2024

ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED HKFRSs AND CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
POLICY
(a)

Application of new and revised HKFRSs
The Group has applied the following amendments to HKFRSs and interpretation issued by the
HKICPA for the first time, which are mandatorily effective for the annual period beginning on or after
1 January 2024 for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
Amendments to HKAS 1
Amendments to HKAS 1
Amendments to HKFRS 16
Hong Kong Interpretation 5
(“HK Int 5”) (Revised)
Amendments to HKAS 7 and
HKFRS 7

Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current
Non-current Liabilities with Covenants
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback
Presentation of Financial Statements – Classification by the
Borrower of a Term Loan that Contains a Repayment on
Demand Clause
Supplier Finance Arrangements

The application of the amendments and interpretation listed above did not have any material impact
on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or
future periods.
(b)

Change in accounting policy as a result of application of the HKICPA guidance on the
accounting implications of the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) – Long
Service Payment (“LSP”) offsetting mechanism in Hong Kong
The Group has several subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong which are obliged to pay LSP to
employees under certain circumstances. Meanwhile, the Group makes mandatory MPF contributions
to the trustee who administers the assets held in a trust solely for the retirement benefits of each
individual employee. Offsetting of LSP against an employee’s accrued retirement benefits derived
from employers’ MPF contributions was allowed under the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57). In June
2022, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region gazetted the Employment
and Retirement Schemes Legislation (Offsetting Arrangement) (Amendment) Ordinance 2022 (the
“Amendment Ordinance”) which abolishes the use of the accrued benefits derived from employers’
mandatory MPF contributions to offset severance payment and LSP (the “Abolition”). The Abolition
will officially take effect on 1 May 2025 (the “Transition Date”). In addition, under the Amendment
Ordinance, the last month’s salary immediately preceding the Transition Date (instead of the date
of termination of employment) is used to calculate the portion of LSP in respect of the employment
period before the Transition Date.

ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED HKFRSs AND CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
POLICY (CONTINUED)
(b)

Change in accounting policy as a result of application of the HKICPA guidance on the
accounting implications of the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) – Long
Service Payment (“LSP”) offsetting mechanism in Hong Kong (Continued)
In July 2023, the HKICPA published “Accounting implications of the abolition of the MPF-LSP
offsetting mechanism in Hong Kong” which provides guidance for the accounting for the offsetting
mechanism and the impact arising from abolition of the MPF-LSP offsetting mechanism in Hong
Kong. In light of this, the Group has implemented the guidance published by the HKICPA in
connection with the LSP obligation retrospectively so as to provide more reliable and more relevant
information about the effects of the offsetting mechanism and the Abolition.
The Group considered the accrued benefits arising from employer MPF contributions that have
been vested with the employee and which could be used to offset the employee’s LSP benefits as
a deemed contribution by the employee towards the LSP. Historically, the Group has been applying
the practical expedient in paragraph 93(b) of HKAS 19 to account for the deemed employee
contributions as a reduction of the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered.
Based on the HKICPA’s guidance, as a result of the Abolition, these contributions are no longer
considered “linked solely to the employee’s service in that period” since the mandatory employer
MPF contributions after the Transition Date can still be used to offset the pre-transition LSP
obligation. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to view the contributions as “independent of the
number of years of service” and the practical expedient in paragraph 93(b) of HKAS 19 is no longer
applicable. Instead, these deemed contributions should be attributed to periods of service in the
same manner as the gross LSP benefit applying paragraph 93(a) of HKAS 19.
The Abolition of the offsetting mechanism did not have a material impact on the Group’s opening
balance of equity at 1 January 2023, and the profit or loss and basic and diluted earnings per share
for the year ended 31 December 2023. Therefore, the comparative figures as of and for the year
ended 31 December 2023, and the opening balance as at 1 January 2023 have not been restated.
Alternatively, the Group has recognised a cumulative catch-up adjustment of US$60,000 for the year
ended 31 December 2024 with the corresponding adjustment to the LSP obligation as included in
Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impact on the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of profit
or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2024:
Increase
/(decrease) in
US$’000
Administrative expenses

70

Profit for year and the profit attributable to owners of the Company
Other comprehensive income

(70)
10

Total comprehensive income for the year and the total
comprehensive income attributable to owners of the Company

(60)

The change of accounting policy did not have impact on the Group’s cash flow. The impact to the
basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2024 was below US0.01 cent
per share.

ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED HKFRSs AND CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING
POLICY (CONTINUED)
(c)

Revised HKFRSs in issue but not yet effective
Up to the date of issue of these consolidated financial statements, the HKICPA has issued a number
of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretation, which are not effective for the
year ended 31 December 2024 and which have not been adopted in these financial statements. The
Group has not early applied the following which may be relevant to the Group:
Effective for
accounting periods
beginning on or after
Amendments to HKAS 21 and HKFRS 1 – Lack of Exchangeability

1 January 2025

Amendments to HKFRS 9 and HKFRS 7 – Classification and
Measurement of Financial Instruments

1 January 2026

Annual Improvements to HKFRS Accounting Standards – Volume 11

1 January 2026

HKFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

1 January 2027

Amendments to HK Int 5 – Presentation of Financial Statements –
Classification by the Borrower of a Term Loan that Contains a
Repayment on Demand Clause

1 January 2027

Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 – Sale or Contribution of
Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

To be determined
by the HKICPA

The directors of the Company are in the process of making an assessment of what the impacts of
these new standards, amendments to standards and interpretation that are expected to be in the
period of initial application. So far it has concluded that the adoption of them is unlikely to have a
significant impact on the consolidated financial statements except for the adoption of HKFRS 18 –
Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements.

POLICY (CONTINUED)
(c)

Revised HKFRSs in issue but not yet effective (Continued)
HKFRS 18 “Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements”
HKFRS 18 will replace HKAS 1 “Presentation of financial statements”, introducing new requirements
that will help to achieve comparability of the financial performance of similar entities and provide
more relevant information and transparency to users. Even though this new HKFRS Accounting
Standard will not impact the recognition or measurement of items in the consolidated financial
statements, it introduces significant changes to the presentation of financial statements, with a focus
on information about financial performance present in the statement of profit or loss, which will affect
how the Group present and disclose financial performance in the financial statements. The key
changes introduced in HKFRS 18 relate to (i) the structure of the statement of profit or loss, and (ii)
enhanced requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of information.
The directors of the Company are currently assessing the impact of applying HKFRS 18 on the
presentation and the disclosures of the consolidated financial statements.

4.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless
mentioned otherwise in the accounting policies below (e.g. certain financial instruments that are measured
at fair value).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgements in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The area involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or area
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

96

YesAsia Holdings Limited Annual Report 2024

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2024

4.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise
stated.
(a)

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and
its subsidiaries made up to 31 December. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has
control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the
entity. The Group has power over an entity when the Group has existing rights that give it the current
ability to direct the relevant activities, i.e. activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns.
When assessing control, the Group considers its potential voting rights as well as potential voting
rights held by other parties. A potential voting right is considered only if the holder has the practical
ability to exercise that right.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are
de-consolidated from the date the control ceases.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised profits are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly,
to the Company. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial
position and consolidated statement of changes in equity within equity. Non-controlling interests are
presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of profit or loss
and other comprehensive income as an allocation of profit or loss and total comprehensive income
for the year between the non-controlling shareholders and owners of the Company.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners
of the Company and to the non-controlling shareholders even if this results in the non-controlling
interests having a deficit balance.

(b)

Separate financial statements
In the Company’s statement of financial position, an investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost less
impairment loss, unless the investment is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group
that is classified as held for sale). Cost includes direct attributable costs of investments. The results
of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividend received or receivable.
Impairment testing of the investments in subsidiaries is required upon receiving a dividend from
these investments if the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the
period the dividend is declared or if the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial
statements exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee’s
net assets including goodwill.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(c)

Foreign currency translation
(i)

Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the
“functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US$, which is
the Company’s functional and presentation currency.

(ii)

Transactions and balances in each entity’s financial statements
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency on initial
recognition using the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the end of each
reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from this translation policy are recognised in profit
or loss.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
currency are translated using the foreign exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. The
transaction date is the date on which the entity initially recognises such non-monetary assets
or liabilities. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in foreign currencies are
translated using the exchange rates at the dates when the fair values are determined.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income,
any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in profit or loss, any exchange
component of that gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

(iii)

Translation on consolidation
The results and financial position of all foreign operations (none of which has the currency
of hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Company’s
presentation currency are translated into the Company’s presentation currency as follows:
–

Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at
the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;

–

Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period (unless
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated
at the exchange rates on the transaction dates); and

–

All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of monetary items that
form part of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation
is sold, such exchange differences are reclassified to consolidated profit or loss as part of the
gain or loss on disposal.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or
for administrative purposes. Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement
of financial position at cost, less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated
impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow
to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance
are recognised in profit or loss during the period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated at rates sufficient to write off their cost
less their residual values over the estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. The principal useful
lives are as follows:
Leasehold improvements
Furniture and fixtures
Computer software and equipment
Motor vehicles

Over the lease term
5 years
3–5 years
5 years

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate,
at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a
prospective basis.
The gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.
(e)

Leases
At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset
for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is conveyed where the customer has
both the right to direct the use of the identified asset and to obtain substantially all of the economic
benefits from that use.
Where the contract contains lease component(s) and non-lease component(s), the Group has
elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for each lease component and any
associated non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases.

(e)

Leases (Continued)
At the lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability,
except for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value
assets. When the Group enters into a lease in respect of a low-value asset, the Group decides
whether to capitalise the lease on a lease-by-lease basis. The lease payments associated with those
leases which are not capitalised are recognised as an expense on a systematic basis over the lease
term.
Where the lease is capitalised, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease
payments payable over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
that rate cannot be readily determined, using a relevant incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments
to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the
lease liability. After initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost and interest
expense is calculated using the effective interest method.
Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement
of the lease liability and hence are charged to profit or loss in the accounting period in which they are
incurred.
To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:
•

uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for
leases held by the individual lessee, which does not have recent third-party financing, and

•

makes adjustments specific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.

If a readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent
financing or market data) which has a similar payment profile to the lease, then the individual lessee
uses that rate as a starting point to determine the incremental borrowing rate.
The right-of-use asset recognised when a lease is capitalised is initially measured at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability plus any lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, and any initial direct costs incurred. Where applicable, the cost of the rightof-use assets also includes an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to
restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, discounted to their present value, less
any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

(e)

Leases (Continued)
Right-of-use assets in which the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying
leased assets at the end of the lease term are depreciated from commencement date to the end of
the useful life. Otherwise, right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of its estimated useful life and the lease term.
When the Group obtains ownership of the underlying leased assets at the end of the lease term,
upon exercising purchase options, the cost of the relevant right-of-use assets and the related
accumulated depreciation are transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 and initially measured at fair value.
Adjustments to fair value at initial recognition are considered as additional lease payments and
included in the cost of right-of-use assets.
The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in the scope of a lease or the consideration
for a lease that is not originally provided for in the lease contract that is not accounted for as a
separate lease. In this case the lease liability is remeasured based on the revised lease payments
and lease term using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

(f)

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the
weighted average basis and comprises costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs
necessary to make the sale.

(g)

Contract liabilities
A contract liability is recognised when the customer pays consideration before the Group recognises
the related revenue (see Note 4(m)). A contract liability would also be recognised if the Group has an
unconditional right to receive consideration before the Group recognises the related revenue. In such
cases, a corresponding receivable would also be recognised (see Note 4(j)).

(h)

Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial
position when the Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that
are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other
than financial assets and financial liabilities at FVTPL) are added to or deducted from the fair value
of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from
the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the
Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the
Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for
the proceeds received.
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are
discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

(i)

Financial assets
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade
date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require
delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or
fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.
Debt investments
Debt investments held by the Group are classified into one of the following measurement categories:
–

amortised cost, if the investment is held for the collection of contractual cash flows which
represent solely payments of principal and interest. Interest income from the investment is
calculated using the effective interest method.

–

Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) – recycling, if the contractual cash
flows of the investment comprise solely payments of principal and interest and the investment is
held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both the collection of contractual
cash flows and sale. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income,
except for the recognition in profit or loss of expected credit losses (“ECL”), interest income
(calculated using the effective interest method) and foreign exchange gains and losses. When
the investment is derecognised, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income is
recycled from equity to profit or loss.

–

FVTPL, if the investment does not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost
or FVTOCI (recycling). Changes in the fair value of the investment (including interest) are
recognised in profit or loss.

Equity investments
An investment in equity securities is classified as FVTPL unless the equity investment is not held
for trading purposes and on initial recognition of the investment the Group makes an election to
designate the investment at FVTOCI (non-recycling) such that subsequent changes in fair value are
recognised in other comprehensive income. Such elections are made on an instrument-by-instrument
basis, but may only be made if the investment meets the definition of equity from the issuer’s
perspective. Where such an election is made, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive
income remains in the fair value reserve (non-recycling) until the investment is disposed of. At the
time of disposal, the amount accumulated in the fair value reserve (non-recycling) is transferred to
retained earnings. It is not recycled through profit or loss. Dividends from an investment in equity
securities, irrespective of whether classified as at FVTPL or FVTOCI, are recognised in profit or loss as
other income.

(j)

Trade and other receivables
A receivable is recognised when the Group has an unconditional right to receive consideration. A
right to receive consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before payment
of that consideration is due. If revenue has been recognised before the Group has an unconditional
right to receive consideration, the amount is presented as a contract asset.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless
they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group
holds the trade receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows and therefore
measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less allowance
for credit losses.

(k)

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits with banks and
other financial institutions, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, having
been within three months of maturity at acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents are assessed for
ECL.

(l)

Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument under
HKFRSs. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial
liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
(i)

Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the effect of discounting would
be immaterial, in which case they are stated at cost.

(ii)

Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidence a residual interest in the assets of an entity
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Revenue and other income
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents
amounts receivable for the E-commerce transactions and offline wholesale of products, stated net of
value added taxes, sales taxes, returns, rebates and discounts.
Revenue is recognised when specific criteria have been met for the Group’s activity described below:
(i)

Sale of goods – E-commerce transactions
The Group sells products through E-commerce platforms. Revenue from the sale of goods
is recognised on a trade date basis when the relevant transactions are executed and there
is no unfulfilled obligation that affect the customer’s acceptance of the goods sold. Payment
of the transaction price is due immediately when the customer purchases the goods. As part
of the Group’s ordinary activities for the E-commerce transactions, discount coupons and
credit points are issued and granted to customers, and the receipts in respect of which are
deferred and recognised as “contract liabilities” on the consolidated statement of financial
position. Any non-redeemed discount coupons and points are referred to as breakage. An
expected breakage amount in receipts in advance is determined by historical experience and is
recognised as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemptions by the customers.
The Group estimates the sales return provision based on accumulated historical experience.

(ii)

Sale of goods – Offline wholesale
Sales are recognised when control of the products has transferred, being at the point the
goods have been shipped in accordance with the terms of contract, to the wholesaler. The
wholesaler has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no
unfulfilled obligation that affects the wholesaler’s acceptance of the products.
The goods are often sold with sales discounts. Revenue from these sales is recognised
based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts, if any. No
element of financing is deemed present.

(iii)

Customer loyalty programme
The Group operates a customer loyalty programme, where certain customers accumulate
points for purchases made which entitle them to purchase goods at certain discounts on
future purchases. The customer loyalty programme gives rise to a separate performance
obligation because it provides a material right to the customer and allocates a portion of the
transaction price to the loyalty credits awarded to customers based on the relative standalone selling price. The amount allocated to the loyalty programme is recognised as a contract
liability, and revenue is recognised when the rewards are redeemed or expire.

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment are
established.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method. For financial
assets measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI (recycling) that are not credit-impaired, the
effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset. For credit impaired
financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying
amount net of loss allowance) of the asset.

Employee leave entitlements
Employee entitlements to annual leave and long service leave are recognised when they

service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting
period.
Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of
leave.

Pension obligations – defined contribution plans
Hong Kong
The Group contributes to defined contribution MPF Scheme under the Mandatory Provident
Fund Schemes Ordinance in Hong Kong, for those employees who are eligible to participate
in the MPF Scheme. Contributions to the schemes by the Group and employees are
calculated as a percentage of employees’ basic salaries. The retirement benefit scheme cost
charged to profit or loss represents contributions payable by the Group to the funds.
Korea
The Group and the employees in Korea are required to participate in a National Pension
Scheme which is a defined contribution plan operated by the local municipal government. The
contributions are charged to profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the
rules of the National Pension Scheme.
United Kingdom
The Group participates in a defined contribution scheme in the United Kingdom. The Group
pays contributions to workplace pension schemes on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary
basis, calculated as a percentage of employees’ basic salaries. The Group has no further
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised
as employee benefit expense when they are due.

(iii)

Post employment benefits
Hong Kong
The Group has a defined benefit plan for LSP under the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current
and prior periods and discounting that amount. For LSP obligations, the estimated amount of
future benefit is determined after deducting the negative service cost arising from the accrued
benefits derived from the Group’s MPF contributions that have been vested with employees,
which are deemed to be contributions from the relevant employees.
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit credit method. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans, which
comprise actuarial gains and losses, and the effect of any asset ceiling (excluding interest), are
recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Net interest expense for the period
is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation
at the beginning of the reporting period to the then net defined benefit liability, taking into
account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period. Net interest expense
and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

Korea
Under Guarantee of Workers’ Retirement Benefits Act in Korea, an employee is entitled
to receive severance payment at the rate of 30 days’ average wages for each continuous
year of service. Average wages are calculated by using wages for the 3 months preceding
termination and includes variable income for the past 3 months and bonus from past 12
months. Employees who have served less than 1 year service are not entitled to severance
payment.
United Kingdom
Under Employment Rights Act 1996 in the United Kingdom, an employee is entitled
to statutory redundancy pay if the employee has been employed for 2 years or more.
Redundancy pay is calculated in accordance to age of the employee and the length of service
which is capped at 20 years.

Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised at the earlier of the dates when the Group can no longer
withdraw the offer of those benefits, and when the Group recognises restructuring costs and
involves the payment of termination benefits.

(o)

Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain directors and employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value (excluding the effect of nonmarket-based vesting conditions) of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straightline basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest
and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
When the share options are exercised, the Company issues new shares. The proceeds received net
of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share
premium respectively.

Taxation
Income tax represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit
recognised in profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference
arises from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the
taxable profit nor the accounting profit and at the time of transaction does not give rise to equal
taxable and deductible temporary differences.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it relates
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred
tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would
follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or
settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Taxation (Continued)
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognises
the right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax
deductions are attributable to the right-of-use assets or the lease liabilities.
For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group
applies HKAS 12 requirements to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately. The Group
recognises a deferred tax asset related to lease liabilities to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised and a
deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis,
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(r)

Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date for indications
of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down as an expense through the
consolidated statement of profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, recoverable
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is
the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal of the individual asset or the cashgenerating unit.
Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the asset/cash-generating unit.
Present values are computed using pre-tax discount rates that reflect the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset/cash-generating unit whose impairment is being measured.
Impairment losses for cash-generating units are allocated pro rata amongst the assets of the cashgenerating unit. Subsequent increases in the recoverable amount caused by changes in estimates
are credited to profit or loss to the extent that they reverse the impairment.

Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for ECL on trade and other receivables, pledged bank fixed
deposits and bank and cash balances. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to
reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.
The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables. The ECL on these financial assets
are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment
of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time
value of money where appropriate.
For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial
instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss
allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.
Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected
life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is
expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months
after the reporting date.
Significant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial
recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the
reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial
recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative
information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking
information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered
includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from
economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other
similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast
economic information that relate to the Group’s core operations.

Impairment of financial assets (Continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (Continued)
In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has
increased significantly since initial recognition:
–

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external (if available)
or internal credit rating;

–

significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial
instrument;

–

existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are
expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;

–

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

–

significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; or

–

an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological
environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet
its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on
a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are
more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that
demonstrates otherwise.
Despite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not
increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low
credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if:
(i)

the financial instrument has a low risk of default,

(ii)

the debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near
term, and

(iii)

adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not
necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

Impairment of financial assets (Continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (Continued)
The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when the asset has external credit
rating of “investment grade” in accordance with the globally understood definition or if an external
rating is not available, the asset has an internal rating of “performing”. Performing means that the
counterparty has a strong financial position and there are no past due amounts.
The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been
a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are
capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.
Definition of default
The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk
management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the
following criteria are generally not recoverable.
–

when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

–

information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor
is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any
collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial
asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information
to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets (Continued)
Credit-impaired financial assets
A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the
estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is
credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:
–

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the counterparty;

–

a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;

–

the lender(s) of the counterparty, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the
counterparty’s financial difficulty, having granted to the counterparty a concession(s) that the
lender(s) would not otherwise consider;

–

it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial
reorganisation; or

–

the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.

Write-off policy
The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, including when the debtor
has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case
of trade receivables, when the amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner.
Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery
procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised
in profit or loss.
Measurement and recognition of ECL
The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the
magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the
probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward
looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is
represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date.
For financial assets, the ECL is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that
are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects
to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONTINUED)
(s)

Impairment of financial assets (Continued)
Measurement and recognition of ECL (Continued)
If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to
lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the
conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount
equal to 12-month ECL at the current reporting date, except for assets for which simplified approach
was used.
The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a
corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.

(t)

Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing or amount when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be
made. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are stated at the present value of the
expenditures expected to settle the obligation. The discount rate used to determine the present
value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as
interest expense.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot
be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of
outflow is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or
non-occurrence of one or more future events are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the
probability of outflow is remote.

(u)

Events after the reporting period
Events after the reporting period that provide additional information about the Group’s position at the
end of the reporting period or those that indicate the going concern assumption is not appropriate
are adjusting events and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Events after the
reporting period that are not adjusting events are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements when material.

CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND KEY ESTIMATES
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 4, the directors are required to
make judgements (other than those involving estimations) that have a significant impact on the amounts
recognised and to make estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period,
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
(a)

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies
In the process of applying the accounting policies, the directors have made the following judgements
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Determining the lease term
In determining the lease term at the commencement date for leases that include renewal options
exercisable by the Group, the Group evaluates the likelihood of exercising the renewal options taking
into account all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group
to exercise the option, including favourable terms, leasehold improvements undertaken and the
importance of that underlying asset to the Group’s operation.
The management considers the relevant facts and circumstances that there is no economic incentive
for the Group to exercise the extension options and therefore the Group is not reasonably certain to
exercise the option upon entering the lease agreements. Refer to Note 19 for further information.
The lease term is reassessed when there is a significant event or significant change in circumstance
that is within the Group’s control. Any increase or decrease in the lease term would affect the
amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised in the future years. During the current
financial year, no lease term has been reassessed.

(b)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Allowance for slow-moving inventories and net realisable value of inventories
Allowance for slow-moving inventories is made based on the ageing and estimated net realisable
value of inventories. The assessment of the allowance amount involves judgement and estimates.
Where the actual outcome in future is different from the original estimate, such difference will
impact the carrying value of inventories and allowance charge/writeback in the period in which such
estimate has been changed. As at 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of inventories was
US$55,097,000 (net of allowance for inventories of US$955,000) (2023: US$20,849,000 (net of
allowance for inventories of US$786,000)).

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: foreign currency risk, price risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial
performance.
(a)

Foreign currency risk
The Group has certain exposure to foreign currency risk as most of its business transactions, assets
and liabilities are principally denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the
Group entities such as Hong Kong Dollars (“HK$”), Canadian dollar (“CAD”), Mexican Peso (“MXN”)
and Euro (“EUR”). As US$ is pegged to HK$, the Group does not expect any significant movements
in the US$/HK$ exchange rate.
The Group currently does not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy but will consider hedging
significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise.
Sensitivity analysis
The following table indicates the approximate change in the Group’s profit for the year in response
to reasonably possible changes in the foreign exchange rates of CAD, MXN and EUR to which the
Group has significant exposure at the end of the reporting period. The sensitivity analysis of the
Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period has been determined
based on the exchange rate fluctuation at the beginning and the end of the year.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(a)

Foreign currency risk (Continued)
The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to currency risk at the reporting date has been
determined based on the hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates which are commensurate
with historical fluctuation during the years ended 31 December 2024 and 2023. The assumed
changes represent management’s assessment of reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange
rates over the year until the next reporting date.

(b)

Price risk
The Group is exposed to equity price risk through its investment in listed equity security. The
management manages this exposure by investing solely on equity security operating in logistic sector
quoted on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at
the end of the reporting period.
If equity prices had been 10% higher/lower (2023: 10% higher/lower), profit after tax for the year
ended 31 December 2024 would increase/decrease by US$49,000 (2023: increase/decrease by
US$86,000). This is solely due to the change in fair value of the share price.

(c)

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or
customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily trade and other receivables) and from its financing activities including deposits
with banks and financial institutions. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from cash and cash
equivalents is limited because the counterparties are banks and financial institutions with high creditrating assigned by international credit-rating agencies, for which the Group considers to have low
credit risk.
No significant credit risk has been identified for the E-commerce business, as customers are
generally required to pay in advance through third-party payment platforms before the delivery of
goods. These platforms typically settle the amounts received, net of handling charges, within one
month after the trade date. The receivables from third-party payment platforms represent payments
that are pending settlement. Management has implemented a credit policy and continuously
monitors exposures to credit risks. Given that these receivables are from reputable third-party
payment platforms with no history of defaults, the directors consider the credit risk to be minimal,
and no impairment has been recognised for these receivables.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2024

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(c)

Credit risk (Continued)
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer rather than the industry or country in which the customers operate or locate and therefore
significant concentrations of credit risk primarily arise when the Group has significant exposure to
individual customers. The Group’s largest customer shared nearly 8.2% (2023: 7.7%) of the trade
receivables at the end of each reporting period. The Group has policies and procedures to monitor
the collection of the trade receivables to limit the exposure to the non-recovery of the receivables
and there is no recent history of default for the Group’s largest customer.
Individual credit evaluations are performed on all wholesale and logistic customers requiring credit
over a certain amount. These evaluations focus on the customer’s past history of making payments
when due and current ability to pay and take into account information specific to the customer as
well as pertaining to the economic environment in which the customer operates. Trade receivables
for customers are due within 180 days from the date of invoice. Normally, the Group does not obtain
collateral from customers.
The Group measures loss allowances for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, which is
calculated using a provision matrix. As the Group’s historical credit loss experience does not indicate
significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments, the loss allowance based on
past due status is not further distinguished between the Group’s different customer bases. The ECL
rate of trade receivables as at 31 December 2024 and 2023 is less than 1%. As at 31 December
2024, loss allowance accounted for in respect of trade receivables during the year is US$1,000 (2023:
US$1,000).

(d)

Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to regularly monitor its current and expected liquidity requirements, its
compliance with lending covenants and its relationship with its bankers to ensure that it maintains
sufficient reserves of cash to meet its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(e)

Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk mainly arises from its bank deposits. These deposits bear
interest at variable rates that vary with the then prevailing market condition.
The Group’s pledged and non-pledged bank fixed deposits bear interest at fixed interest rates and
therefore are subject to fair value interest rate risks.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following disclosures of fair value
measurements use a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value:
Level 1 inputs:

quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the
Group can access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs:

inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs:

unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of any of the three levels as of the date of
the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

Information reported to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Group, being the chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”), for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance focuses
on types of goods delivered, or service provided. The CEO has chosen to organise the Group’s results
according to the category of the business segment and differences in nature of the goods and services that
each segment delivers.
The Group has two operating segments as follows:
Fashion & lifestyle and
beauty products

–

Trading of fashion wears, lifestyle products and beauty products to
consumer

Entertainment products

–

Trading of entertainment products to consumer

The Group’s other operating segments represent revenue from logistic and ancillary services. None of these
segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments. The information of
these other operating segments is included in the “unallocated” column.
No analysis of segment assets or segment liabilities is presented as such information is not regularly
provided to the CODM.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies
described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Segment results do not include unallocated
administrative expenses, other income, other gains and losses and finance costs that are not directly
attributable to segments and income tax expense.

Under the two-tiered Profits Tax regime, the first HK$2 million of profits of the qualifying group entity

Notes: (Continued)
(b)

Details of total cash outflow for leases is set out in Note 33(b).

(c)

The Group leases various leased properties and office equipment for its operations. Lease contracts
are entered into for fixed terms of 2 years to 5 years (2023: 2 years to 4 years), but may have extension
and termination options as described below. Certain leases of equipment were accounted for as finance
leases during the reporting period and carried interest ranging from 1.96% to 6.12% (2023: from 1.96%
to 2.64%). Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms
and conditions. In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period, the
Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

(d)

Some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period after the end of the contract
term. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include such extension options exercisable by the Group to
provide operational flexibility. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably
certain to exercise the extension options. If the Group is not reasonably certain to exercise the extension
options, the future lease payments during the extension periods are not included in the measurement of
lease liabilities. The potential exposure to these future lease payments is summarised below:

In addition, the Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, upon
the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that is within the
control of the lessee. During the year ended 31 December 2024, there has been no such triggering event.

In August 2019, the Company’s subsidiary, YesStyle.com Limited, entered into a life insurance policy
with an insurance company to insure Mr. Lau Kwok Chu, a director of the Company. Under the policy,
the beneficiary and the policy holder is YesStyle.com Limited and the total insured sum is US$2,462,000.
The Group was required to pay a one-off premium payment of US$860,000 at the inception of the policy.
A guaranteed interest rate of 3.9% per annum applied for the first 5 years, followed by the discretionary
portion with a minimum guaranteed interest rate of 2.25% per annum for the following years until
termination. The Group can terminate the policy at any time and receive cash back based on the cash
value of the policy at the date of withdrawal (“Cash Surrender Value”), which is determined by the premium
payment plus accumulated guaranteed interest earned minus the accumulated insurance charges, policy
expense charges and a specified amount of surrender charge if the withdrawal is made between 1st to
16th policy year.
The carrying amount represented the Cash Surrender Value of the policy and approximates its fair value at
the end of the reporting period. Details of fair value measurement are set out in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Before accepting new wholesales or logistic customers, the Group assesses the potential customers’ credit
quality and defines credit limits for each individual customer. Recoverability of the existing customers is
reviewed by the management of the Group regularly.
The Group’s turnover primarily comprises E-commerce sales, offline wholesale of products, and income
from logistics and ancillary services. E-commerce sales are typically conducted without credit terms, while
credit terms of up to 180 days are offered for offline wholesale and logistics and ancillary services.
The aging analysis of trade receivables, based on the revenue recognition date (i.e. invoice date), at the end
of each reporting period and net of allowance, is as follows:

Notes:
(i)

When the Group receives the payment in full before the goods is shipped/delivered, this will give rise
to contract liabilities at the start of a contract, until the revenue recognised when the goods is shipped/
delivered to the customers.

(ii)

Contract liabilities relating to deferred revenue for loyalty programme are a portion of the transaction price
allocated to the memberships based on the relative stand-alone selling price.

(iii)

Store credit is a type of refund offered by the Group to a customer who returns an item that allows them to
purchase something in the Group up to the value of a returned item. Store credit would be valid for 2 years
upon the grant date. As at 31 December 2024, store credits granted to customers of US$362,000 (2023:
US$2,522,000) were unused and expired in accordance with the terms of use of the Group. Such expired
and unused store credits were written back. Accordingly, the Group recognised revenue of US$362,000
for the year ended 31 December 2024 (2023: US$2,522,000) arising from the written back of the expired
and unused store credits.

The significant changes in the contract liabilities balances during the year ended 31 December 2024 were
mainly due to the Group’s customer base being broadened as compared to the year ended 31 December
2023, resulting in an increase in contract liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2024.
Except the store credits which would be valid for 2 years upon the grant date, all of the remaining contract
liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue within one year.

payments for employees.

During the year ended 31 December 2024, 12,588,556 (2023: 1,162,000) ordinary shares of the Company
were issued under share option schemes. The net proceeds of US$2,026,000 (2023: US$92,000) were
credited to share capital with the average market price of approximately US$0.55 (2023: US$0.09) per
share at the respective exercise days.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern and to maximise the return to the members through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and
makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the
underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares,
buy-back shares, raise new debts, redeemed existing debts or sell assets to reduce debts.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is the Group’s total debts (comprising lease
liabilities) over its total equity. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio at a reasonable level. The
Group’s gearing ratios as at 31 December 2024 was 43.0% (2023: 34.8%). The increase in the gearing
ratio of the Group is primarily due to the increase in lease liabilities and the increase in equity as a result of
the profit generated for the year ended 31 December 2024.
The externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are: (i) in order to maintain its listing on the Stock
Exchange it has to have a public float of at least 25% of the shares; and (ii) to meet financial covenants
attached to the banking facilities granted.
Based on information that is publicly available to the Company and within the knowledge of the directors of
the Company, as at the date of this annual report, the Company has maintained sufficient public float with
at least 25% of the shares held by the public as required under the Listing Rules.
There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any of these banking facilities for the years
ended 31 December 2024 and 2023.
